      <h2>Lesson 2.6 Sleep</h2>
      <p>
        Circadian rhythms occur on a 24-hour cycle and induce sleep and
        wakefulness. It is controlled by the hypothalamus and the
        suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN. It receives input from the eyes and is
        sensitive to the light and dark cycles of day and night.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Light signals the SCN and pineal gland to stop melatonin release. In
        darkness the SCN doesn’t get alerted, meaning melatonin levels and
        sleepiness will increase. This pattern will cycle through daily through
        exposure to light and our routines. When time cues disappear, natural
        circadian rhythms become 25 hours long.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Pineal gland-</h4>
      <p>Produces melatonin</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sleep cycle-</h4>
      <p>
        A cycle is 90 minutes long. Stage 1 to REM is one cycle. Stages 1-4 are
        quiet sleep. In stage 1 we drift to sleep and experience images and
        hallucination, similar to a falling or floating sensation. In stage 2 we
        are clearly asleep with sleep spindles and a k complex, where sleep
        talking can happen. In stage 3 deep sleep occurs and it acts as a
        transitional stage to deeper sleep. Stage 4 is the deepest sleep and
        only occurs in the first few cycles of the night.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>REM sleep-</h4>
      <p>
        The paradoxical sleep stage. After reaching stage 4, the cycle will
        start moving backwards to REM (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, REM). The brain engages
        in low amplitude fast and regular beta waves, as if it was an awake and
        aroused state. People in REM exhibit rapid eye movement (REM) and have
        vivid dreams. The brain is very active, but the muscles are very
        relaxed, hence the paradox. Genital arousal can happen in REM sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With each cycle, stage 4 sleep decreases and REM stage increases.
        Typically, there are 4-6 cycles a night.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sleep-</h4>
      <p>
        We spend 1/3 of our life sleeping. Genetics influence how much sleep we
        need but humans will sleep 9-10 hours naturally. Adults will require
        less than children. The brain doesn’t allow for makeup of lost sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sleep deprivation-</h4>
      <p>
        Sleep is a necessary biological function. Lack of sleep results in
        difficulty focusing, less productivity, higher tendency of mistakes,
        irritability, fatigue, weaker immune system, obesity, and hallucinations
        if extreme.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Half of Americans get less sleep than they should</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Naps-</h4>
      <p>Naps can improve alertness. They are biologically beneficial.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Theories-</h4>
      <p>
        Sleeping in the darkness in safe locations helped protect our ancestors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Sleep restores brain and body tissue.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Sleep rebuilds fading memories.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sleep allows for the pituitary glands to release growth hormones. Older
        people release less and also sleep less.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sleep disorders-</h4>
      <p>Insomnia is difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Narcolepsy is the overpowering urge to fall asleep while standing. They
        lapse directly into REM sleep. It is linked with a lack of orexin, a
        neurotransmitter that deals with alertness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Night terrors are sudden arousals from sleep and intense fear from
        psychological reactions that occur during stage 4 sleep. Related to
        sleepwalking/somnambulism.

      <h4>Sleepwalking-</h4>
      <p>
        An animated state while asleep in stage 4. The technical name is
        somnambulism.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        REM behavior disorder or RBD is when the muscles aren’t paralyzed in REM
        which allows for people to act out their dreams, especially violent and
        intense ones.
