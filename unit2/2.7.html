      <h2>Lesson 2.7 Dreams</h2>
      <p>
        Dreams unfold like a story, like mental imagery. They have a likeness to
        daily activities but more bizarre. We dream about things we’ve seen or
        stressors we’ve thought about.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>A recurring dream is remembering or experiencing an old dream.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Wish fulfillment-</h4>
      <p>
        Sigmund Freud said dreams are a safety valve to discharge unconscious
        desires. Manifest content is what happens in a dream. The latent content
        is the underlying meaning of the dream.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Information processing-</h4>
      <p>Dreams sift and sort through our day’s experiences in our memories.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Physiological Function-</h4>
      <p>
        Dreams periodically stimulate the brain and preserve neural pathways.
        Neural networks of babies are developing so they need a lot of sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Activation synthesis theory-</h4>
      <p>
        The brain engages in a lot of random neural activity, so dreams are a
        kind of interpretation of the brain's activity. They essentially mean
        nothing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Development-</h4>
      <p>
        Researchers say we dream as part of brain maturation and cognitive
        development. We need REM sleep, and when reintroduced to it after being
        deprived, increased REM sleep is displayed called REM rebound.

      <h4>Glial cells-</h4>
      <p>Cells that support the brain and brain cells</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Aphasia-</h4>
      <p>
        A comprehension and communication disorder from damage to an area in the
        brain
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Neuro genesis-</h4>
      <p>The growth and development of nervous tissue</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dual processing-</h4>
      <p>
        Information being processed on separate conscious and unconscious tracks
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dendrites receive, axon release</h4>
      <p>Multiple sclerosis-</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Disease that degenerates patches of myelin sheath, slowing neural
        transmission
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reuptake-</h4>
      <p>Neurons receiving chemicals not retrieved by the next neuron</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Glutamate-</h4>
      <p>An excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dissociation-</h4>
      <p>
        A disconnection between a person’s memories, feelings, behaviors, and
        perception. To feel apart from oneself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Near death experience-</h4>
      <p>
        A state of consciousness that involves visions of bright lights and out
        of body experiences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Alpha/delta waves-</h4>
      <p>
        Alpha waves are the slow and relaxed brain waves of the brain in an
        awake state. Delta waves are the slow and large waves associated with
        deep sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hypnosis-</h4>
      <p>
        Can help treat conditions like headaches, pain, asthma, and obesity.
        Memories retrieved in hypnosis are a combination of fact and fiction.
        Hypnosis can help treat pain through distraction. Those with high
        hypnotic responsiveness would likely have a rich imagination and fantasy
        life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social influence theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Hypnotized people believe they are hypnotized and let the hypnotist
        direct their attention accordingly.
