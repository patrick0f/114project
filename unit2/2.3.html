      <h2>Lesson 2.3 The Nervous System</h2>
      <br />
      <h4>Nervous System-</h4>
      <p>
        Consists of all the nerve cells in the body. It is the body’s electro
        chemical communication system. It is composed of the central nervous
        system, containing the brain and spine, and the peripheral nervous
        system, containing the sensory and motor neurons that connects the brain
        and spine to everything else.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The brain is the body’s control center. The spine is the body’s way of
        transmitting messages to and from the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Peripheral nervous system-</h4>
      <p>The peripheral nervous system has 2 parts.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary or automatic functions
        that happen automatically in the body like breathing and digestion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The somatic nervous system (soma=body) controls the voluntary movements
        and communicates between the sensory organs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Autonomic nervous system-</h4>
      <p>The autonomic nervous system has 2 parts.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The sympathetic nervous system controls physical arousal in the body,
        preparing it for stressful situation, expending energy, and initiating
        fight or flight. Increases heartbeat and oxygenated blood, dilates
        pupils, inhibits digestion, stimulates liver glucose release, and
        stimulates epinephrine and norepinephrine release through the adrenal
        gland (part of the endocrine system).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The parasympathetic nervous system calms the body conserves energy, and
        returns to homeostasis. Stimulates digestion, contracts pupils, and
        slows breathing and heart rate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Types of Neurons-</h4>
      <p>
        Sensory neurons (afferent/affect) carry incoming information from the
        sensory receptors to the CNS (spine and brain).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Interneurons are the neurons in the Central nervous system and act as
        messengers between sensory and motor neurons. They help with reflexes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Motor neurons (efferent) carry outgoing info from the CNS to the
        peripheral nervous system.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reflex-</h4>
      <p>
        Any of a number of automatic, unlearned, relatively fixed responses to
        stimuli that do not require conscious effort and that often involve a
        faster response than might be possible if a conscious evaluation of the
        input were required.
