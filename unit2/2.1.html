      <h2>Lesson 2.1 The Neuron</h2>
      <h4>Neuron-</h4>
      <p>A nerve in the brain.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Neural firing process-</h4>
      <p>
        Resting potential is when a neuron is not firing. It has a negative
        charge with potassium ions inside and sodium ions outside. The neuron is
        polarized because sodium and potassium repel each other. This is when
        the neuron is in homeostasis, which is its regular state.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Action potential is the electrical pulse that travels the axon from the
        nucleus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The all or nothing principle is when the nucleus fires pulses completely
        down the axon, or not at all. The impulse maintains the same intensity
        the entire time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the neuron fires its impulse/action potential, it depolarizes.
        This happens when opposites are no longer away from each other because
        sodium from outside rushes into the cell causing potassium ions to rush
        out. This happens all on the axon as a domino effect, one gate opens,
        and sodium goes down the line.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The refractory period is the period after firing the impulse and
        depolarization when the neuron is focused on resetting back to
        homeostasis and unable to fire again. The sodium starts to leave back
        outside, letting potassium come back inside.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Synapse-</h4>
      <p>The open space between two neurons where neurotransmitters cross.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Neurotransmitters are chemical substances that cross the synapse to
        carry messages to neurons.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Receptor sites are points on dendrites that receive certain types of
        neurotransmitters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The synapse is simply a gap, so it is not part of the firing process of
        a neuron.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Neurotransmitters-</h4>
      <p>
        Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that deals with muscle contractions,
        memory, and learning. Alzheimer’s is associated with this.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Dopamine deals with movement and our thought process. It gives a
        rewarding sensation. Too little dopamine is Parkinson’s disease, too
        much is schizophrenia, and it is also involved in drug addiction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Serotonin is involved in emotional states and sleep. Deficient serotonin
        means depression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Norepinephrine (adrenaline) is involved in physical arousal, learning,
        and memory. Too little means depression and stress.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        GABA inhibits brain activity, specifically it inhibits neurons that
        aren’t supposed to be involved in certain activities they shouldn’t be
        involved in. This is involved in anxiety disorders.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Endorphins are pain perception, positive emotions, and give feelings of
        a runners high. It is involved in opiate addictions
      </p>

      <h4>Agonists and Antagonists-</h4>
      <p>
        Outside substances that we consume that affect us psychologically are
        agonists or antagonists. Substances like caffeins or drugs wouldn’t
        affect our bodies if there wasn’t already a chemical in us that had
        their exact same function. These substances interact with
        neurotransmitters at the receptor sites on dendrites of a neuron.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Agonists mimic neurotransmitter activity. They fit into the receptor
        sites but aren’t the same as natural neurotransmitters. Morphine as an
        agonist mimics endorphin.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Antagonists block neurotransmitter activity. They fit in the receptor
        site and prevent the natural neurotransmitters from getting to the
        receptor site and functioning normally. Botox as an antagonist blocks
        acetylcholine. (Antagonists stop/block the hero)
