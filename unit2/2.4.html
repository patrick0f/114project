      <h2>Lesson 2.4 The Brain</h2>
      <p>
        The bottom of the brain, the brainstem, and the middle brain are the
        primitive early developed parts of the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Techniques-</h4>
      <p>
        Brain lesions are when brain tissue is destroyed and studied to see what
        behaviors it has. Usually done for scientific or medicinal purposes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Scans-</h4>
      <p>
        An electroencephalogram, EEG, is an amplified recording of the
        electrical waves sweeping across the brain's surface measured by
        electrodes on the scalp.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging) uses magnetic fields and radio
        waves to make computer generated images that distinguish among types of
        soft brain tissue.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        fMRI scan (functional MRI) measures brain activity by detecting changes
        associated with blood flow. The patient is shown information and the
        brain activity is reflected.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PET scan (positron emission tomography) observes metabolic processes in
        the body and brain through the ingestion of a kind of radioactive
        glucose that is measured by the machine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        CAT (computerized tomography/CT) scan combines x ray images taken from
        different angles of the brain to create cross sectional images of the
        brain and skull.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Parts of the brain-</h4>
      <p>Cerebral cortex is the top of the brain.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Corpus callosum connects/combines the two hemispheres.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cerebellum is the mini brain in the back that controls movement,
        balance, and coordination.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Thalamus is in the center of the brain and receives info from the senses
        and sends out the info to the proper places.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hypothalamus is under the thalamus and controls drives including hunger,
        thirst, sexual urges, and the pituitary gland.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pituitary gland sends signals to your organs and glands using hormones
        to tell them what functions are needed and when
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Pons controls the sleep stages and breathing</p>
      <br />
      <p>Medulla oblongata controls heartbeat</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Reticular Activating system or reticular formation is a band of fibers
        that goes up the back of the brain stem. It controls alertness and
        reactions. Pons, medulla, and reticular formation are all part of the
        brain stem.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Spinal cord carries signals back and forth between your body and your
        brain
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Amygdala controls extreme behaviors like fear and aggression</p>
      <br />
      <p>Hippocampus processes new memories</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Limbic system-</h4>
      <p>
        A set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus that
        control emotion, behavior, motivation, learning, and memory. It includes
        the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Influences emotions during
        sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cingulate gyrus-</h4>
      <p>
        The fold covering the corpus callosum that processes emotions and also
        regulates behavior and automatic motor function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cerebral cortex vs Cerebrum-</h4>
      <p>
        Cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum, the most prominent
        part of the brain. It is made of gray matter that covers the white
        matter of the cerebrum. It is responsible for sophisticated information
        processing in the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Frontal lobe-</h4>
      <p>
        Also called the prefrontal cortex, it controls judgement, planning,
        speech sounds, emotions, personality, temperament, works with motor
        cortex movement, and censors the amygdala.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Case study: Phineas Gage-</h4>
      <p>
        A steel rod entered Gage’s eye and damaged his frontal lobe. He survived
        without any impairment to speech, motor, or memory. The lobe controlled
        planning and his temperament.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Somatoform/motor cortex-</h4>
      <p>
        Controls voluntary movement in peripheral nervous system, behind the
        frontal lobe. When parts of the motor cortex are stimulated,
        corresponding parts of the body will be moved. Movements that are
        precise are controlled by larger portions of the motor cortex.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Homunculus-</h4>
      <p>
        A homunculus is what the body would look like if it were proportionate
        to space taken up in the cortex. The hands would be enlarged since they
        require fine movements and a lot of space in the motor cortex.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sensory/somatosensory cortex-</h4>
      <p>
        Behind the motor cortex, responsible for perceiving touch and pressure
        on the body. When stimulated, pressure on the corresponding part of the
        body would also be felt. The more sensitive the area, the more surface
        area on the cortex is taken up.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Parietal lobe-</h4>
      <p>
        Behind the somatosensory cortex, controls body position and spatial
        reasoning like touch, pressure, temperature, and pain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Temporal lobe-</h4>
      <p>
        Near the ears, controls hearing with primary auditory cortex, stores
        long term memories, speech and language, and understanding
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Occipital lobe-</h4>
      <p>
        Behind the parietal lobe, controls all vision with the primary visual
        cortex, and parts of the cortex corresponds with parts of the retina. It
        receives information from that place and the pieces are put together to
        make an image.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Association areas-</h4>
      <p>
        Uncommitted areas of the brain unrelated to sensory and motor functions
        that are used for higher mental functioning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Wernicke’s Area-</h4>
      <p>
        In the left temporal lobe, responsible for language comprehension and
        expression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Broca’s area-</h4>
      <p>
        In the left frontal lobe responsible for directing motor movement in
        speech.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hemispheres-</h4>
      <p>
        The hemispheres are mirrors of each other. They function as separate
        brains and are connected through the corpus callosum. All activity on
        one side is
