          <h2>Lesson 2.5 Drugs</h2>
          <h4>Psychoactive drug-</h4>
          <p>A chemical substance that alters perception and mood, affecting consciousness.</p><br>
          <p>Continued use of psychoactive drugs will produce tolerance. Repeated exposure to a drug will lessen the effects. Bigger doses will be needed to create similar effects.</p><br>
          <h4>Withdrawal-</h4>
          <p>Stopping taking a drug after an addiction will create withdrawal. Symptoms are sweating, hallucination, itching, and anxiety.</p><br>
          <h4>Dependence-</h4>
          <p>The absence of drug will lead to pain and cravings, physical dependence, and negative emotions, emotional dependence.</p><br>
          <h4>Depressants-</h4>
          <p>Drugs that reduce neural activity and slow the body. Includes alcohol, barbiturates, and opiates.</p><br>
          <h4>Alcohol-</h4>
          <p>In low doses, it relaxes the drinker by slowing the sympathetic nervous system, meaning it lowers inhibitions and judgements. In high doses, it slows reactions, slurs speech, and deteriorates skilled performance. It disrupts memory by interrupting the processing of events into memory, reduces self-awareness, and focuses on the immediate present rather than the long term.</p><br>
          <p>It takes about an hour to metabolize alcohol in a drink. Women do this slower than men because of the difference in muscle content. It makes sleeping harder during stage 3-REM. It is a depressant in both high and low doses.</p><br>
          <h4>Barbiturates-</h4>
 <p>Drugs that mimic alcohol, they depress the central nervous system and lead to impaired memory and judgment in high doses. Barbiturates include Nembutal, Seconal, and amytal.</p><br>
            <h4>Opiates-</h4>
            <p>Opium and derivates (morphine and heroin) depress neural activity to lessen pain and anxiety. They are very addictive.</p><br>
            <h4>Heroin-</h4>
            <p>Gives a short feeling of pleasure that is followed by a desire for more and bigger doses. Methadone is used to combat addiction in small doses.</p><br>
            <h4>Stimulants-</h4>
            <p>Drugs that excite neural activity and speed up the bodyâ€™s functions. Includes caffeine nicotine, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines, and methamphetamines.</p><br>
            <h4>Caffeine/nicotine-</h4>
            <p>Increase heart rate and breathing rate to provide energy. Caffeine is the most widely used drug in the world.</p><br>
            <h4>Nicotine-</h4>
            <p>Triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine to boost alertness and diminish appetite.</p><br>
            <h4>Caffeine-</h4>
            <p>It is found in many foods and medications. Increases alertness and mood, mimicking adenosine. It is physically addicting and can create anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate in high doses. Recommended amount per day is 250 mg.</p><br>
            <h4>Amphetamines-</h4>
            <p>Also known as speed or uppers, suppress appetite and increase concentration, reduce fatigue. Tolerance increases quickly and can increase anxiety and irritability.</p><br>
