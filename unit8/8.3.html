      <h2>Lesson 8.3 Schizophrenia</h2>
      <h4>Psychosis-</h4>
      <p>
        A symptom in which thoughts and emotions are so impaired that contact is
        lost with external reality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Schizophrenia spectrum disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        On a spectrum that encompasses the varying degrees of symptoms a
        schizophrenic person can have.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        1/100 people suffer from it, and it appears in maturing young people
        around the age of 18-20. Both men and women are affected, but men are
        hit by it harder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with schizophrenia often have fragmented, bizarre thinking with
        false beliefs called delusions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Disorganized thinking-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed to occur because of selective attention failure that results in
        fragmented, bizarre thoughts spilling out in random order.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Disorganized perceptions-</h4>
      <p>
        A schizophrenic person can perceive things that aren’t there,
        hallucinations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Inappropriate emotions and actions-</h4>
      <p>
        Emotions or actions that aren’t appropriate to the situation. A
        schizophrenic person can laugh at the news of death or be completely
        apathetic, referred to as flat affect.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Positive symptoms-</h4>
      <p>
        The adding of normal function, the presence of inappropriate behavior.
        Distortion or excess of normal functions that are most frequent in the
        first stages of schizophrenia. Includes delusions, hallucinations,
        disordered speech, and disorganized behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Delusions-</h4>
      <p>
        Distorted false beliefs. Thinking you are a mighty superhero instead of
        a normal office worker.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hallucinations-</h4>
      <p>
        Perception without the corresponding sensation. Includes mostly auditory
        hallucinations, but sometimes can be visual, olfactory, or gustatory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Disorganized speech-</h4>
      <p>
        Disordered thoughts that lead to jumbled words with no actual sense to
        them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Disorganized behavior-</h4>
      <p>
        Inappropriate motor behaviors that are senseless and compulsive, like
        continuously rocking in a chair.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Negative symptoms-</h4>
      <p>
        The removing of normal functions, the absence of appropriate behavior.
        Behavioral deficits that decrease normal function. Includes flat affect,
        avoiding eye contact, expressionless face, apathy, poverty of speech,
        long and slowed speech, slowed movements, and lack of directedness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Chronic process schizophrenia-</h4>
      <p>
        Slow developing schizophrenia with a harder recovery process. This kind
        displays negative symptoms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Acute reactive schizophrenia-</h4>
      <p>
        Rapidly developing schizophrenia with a better recovery process. This
        kind displays positive emotions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Paranoia-</h4>
      <p>
        A common characteristic in schizophrenics where people have a
        preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations, with themes of
        persecution or grandiosity.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Catatonic-</h4>
      <p>
        Immobility or purposeless movements with extreme negativism, and/or
        mimicking of another’s speech and movements.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Childhood schizophrenia-</h4>
      <p>
        A type of schizophrenia where a person loses touch with reality,
        psychosis. Occurs early in life and impacts children’s behavior.
        Includes hallucinations, delusions, irrational behavior, and problems
        carrying out daily tasks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Brain abnormalities-</h4>
      <p>
        Dopamine overactivity and higher levels of dopamine D4 receptors in the
        brain have been shown in schizophrenics. Brain scans show abnormal
        activity in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and amygdala. Adolescent
        schizophrenic patients have been seen to have brain lesions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Schizophrenics also show low activity in the frontal lobes. High
        activity in the thalamus causes hallucinations. The more the hippocampus
        and amygdala is shrunken, the worse the disorder is. If the thalamus is
        small, filtering information and reactions will worsen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Causes-</h4>
      <p>
        Prenatal problems such as low birth weight, birth complications, and
        fetal infections such as influenza can cause these brain abnormalities.
        Someone with an identical twin that has schizophrenia is 50% more likely
        to also have it themselves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Early signs of schizophrenia include maternal schizophrenia, birth
        complications, short attention span, poor muscle coordination,
        disruptive/withdrawn behavior, emotional unpredictability, and poor peer
        relations.
