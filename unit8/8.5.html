      <h2>Lesson 8.5 Dissociative and Personality Disorders</h2>
      <h4>Dissociation-</h4>
      <p>
        Getting lost in the moment while doing something. Characterized by
        separation from critical parts of the personality like memory,
        consciousness, or identity, that are normally integrated. Temporary
        dissociative states are common, like zoning out while driving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dissociative identity disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Previously known as multiple personality disorder, it is a condition
        where a person seems to have several distinct personalities, each of
        which has a different personality. Different identities seem to have
        their own memories and desires, and often the impulses of one identity
        conflicts with that of others because there is only one body for the
        several personalities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Shirley Mason Sybil-</h4>
      <p>
        A teacher with DID who suffered from blackouts and emotional breakdowns.
        She entered psychotherapy with Cornelia B Wilbur, a Freudian
        psychiatrist. She had 17 different personalities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Psychoanalytic perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        A massive repression of unwanted impulses or memories creates a new
        person who acts out on these urges. The true identity can’t handle
        things, so a new personality is created.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Behaviorists-</h4>
      <p>
        Everyone is capable of acting differently in different situations, so
        DID is the extreme version of this acting.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Development of DID-</h4>
      <p>
        The disorder is so rare it is difficult to study its cause. Most
        clinicians believe that the root cause is abuse or trauma in childhood.
        Children separate themselves from the trauma to deal with the situation
        and continue this separation for their entire lives. There are some who
        don’t believe that DID is an actual disorder and that it is just people
        role playing to ease anxiety.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Personality disorders-</h4>
      <p>
        Long standing, inflexible personality traits that impair social
        functioning. Patients seek treatment at the insistence of others, as
        they aren’t distressed by their condition. There are three clusters of
        this disorder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cluster A-</h4>
      <p>Shows odd or eccentric behavior</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those who are paranoid have a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness
        and generalized mistrust of others. Common beliefs include deception
        from others, untrustworthy peers, malicious use of information, hidden
        meaning in otherwise benign words, and unfaithful partners.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Schizoids have a pattern of indifference to social relationships with a
        limited range of emotional expression. This manifests itself in early
        adulthood through emotional detachment.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Schizotypal patients have a pattern of social and interpersonal
        difficulties which includes discomfort with close relationships,
        eccentric behavior, and unusual thoughts of reality. They have distorted
        thinking, strange behavior, and avoid intimacy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cluster B-</h4>
      <p>Shows dramatic or emotional traits</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Borderline people are marked by a pattern of varying moods, self-image,
        and behavior, resulting in impulsive actions and conflicts in
        relationships.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Histrionic people are characterized by a pattern of excessive attention
        seeking emotions beginning in early childhood including seductive
        behavior and a need for approval.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Narcissistic people have a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior with
        exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for
        admiration, and a lack of empathy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Antisocial people are likely the most well-known disorder. They have a
        negative effect on society and a tendency to not obey the law, repeated
        deceitfulness, impulsivity, disregard for safety, and irritability. It
        can’t be diagnosed until 18 years of age, but to be diagnosed,
        individuals have to have shown symptoms since 15 years old. It occurs in
        males more often and sociopaths or psychopaths are associated with
        antisocials.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Causes may be an underdeveloped autonomic and central system, leading to
        low anxiousness and sensitivity to punishment, an underdeveloped
        amygdala, and bad environmental factors such as a lack of parental
        figures or poor discipline. PET scans show reduced activity in the
        frontal lobe. Forms of antisocial personality disorder appear in
        children, but they are considered neurodevelopmental disorders.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Conduct disorder is a repetitive pattern of behavior where the basic
        rights of others and norms are violated, referred to as antisocial
        behaviors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent tendency for anger,
        irritability, arguing, and defiance towards parents and authorities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cluster C-</h4>
      <p>Shows anxious or fearful behavior</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Avoidant people have extreme social inhibition, inadequacy, and
        sensitivity to negative criticism, causing impairment to relationships.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Dependent people are unable to stay alone, showing anxiety when not
        around others and needing reassurance from others to function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Obsessive compulsive personality disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfection, and
        control at the expense of flexibility and efficiency.
