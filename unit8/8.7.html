      <h4>Somatic symptom disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Characterized by physical symptoms that suggest a physical disorder, but

      <h4>Conversion disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Also called functional neurological symptom disorder, it is unexplained
        symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory function suggesting a
        medical condition that can’t be found. The onset is usually after a
        stressful event and common symptoms include paralysis, deafness, and
        difficulty walking. Many of the symptoms are anatomically impossible,
        like glove anesthesia, which is the inability to feel the hand, but
        sensation in the arm still exists.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Conversion episodes are triggered by stressful events or emotional
        conflicts.

        Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy is when someone has a preoccupation with
        making others in proximity ill. Mothers will make their children ill,
