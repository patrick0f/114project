      <h2>Lesson 8.6 Depressive and Bipolar Disorders</h2>
      <h4>Depression-</h4>
      <p>
        The number one reason people seek mental health services. Women are
        twice as likely as men to experiences major depression, and ¼ of women
        will experience it in their lives. Increases with prevalence as new
        generations come.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Symptoms must last for two weeks without a cause, and 2 months for those
        grieving. They include depressed mood, loss of interest in activities,
        weight change, sleep issues, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and
        thoughts of suicide.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Being depressed is not being sad, it is depressed brain activity.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biological perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        A lack of neurotransmitters: serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine can
        cause depression. Depression in the brain is simply a lack of certain
        neurotransmitters, especially serotonin.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social cognitive perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Negative thoughts influence negative behaviors and thought patterns,
        causing the depression cycle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Depression cycle-</h4>
      <p>
        A negative, stressful event causes a pessimistic rumination (thinking)
        style which leads to a hopeless depressed state. This then hampers
        thinking and activity, fueling personal rejection and repeating the
        cycle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Persistent depressive disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Formerly dysthymia, a disorder marked by chronic low energy and poor
        self-esteem. It is seen as a lower grade longer lasting depression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bipolar disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Formerly manic-depressive disorder, a disorder that alternates between
        depression and mania. Depressive symptoms include gloominess,
        withdrawnness, inability to make decisions, fatigue, and slowness of
        thought. Manic symptoms include elation, euphoria, desire to take
        action, hyper activeness, and a multitude of thoughts.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Bipolar I-</h4>
      <p>Those who experience manic episodes and major depressive episodes.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bipolar II-</h4>
      <p>
        Those who experience a lesser mania, hypomania. Those with hypomania
        experience it for at least 4 days.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cyclothymic disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Those with hypomanic and depressive symptoms for at least 2 years but
        the symptoms don’t constitute a full major depressive episode or mania.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biological causes-</h4>
      <p>
        Evidence for an inherited predisposition with bipolar disorder is
        strong. 2/3 bipolar people have a family history of mood disorders.
        Stressful events have also been found to trigger manic episodes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PET scans show that brain activity rises and falls with manic and
        depressive episodes.
