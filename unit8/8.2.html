      <h2>Lesson 8.2 Neurodevelopmental Disorders</h2>
      <h4>Neurodevelopmental disorders-</h4>
      <p>
        A group of disorders that involve distortions in the development of
        basic psychological functions involved in social skills, language,
        perception, or motor behavior. They usually occur and are diagnosed in
        infancy, childhood, or adolescence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Autism spectrum disorders-</h4>
      <p>
        A collection of disorders that show an unusual pattern of social and
        cognitive development starting in childhood that create difficulties in
        social interaction and communication. The spectrum includes high to low
        functioning individuals of the disorder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The onset is usually before the age of 3, and research shows the earlier
        it is detected the more successful the treatment will be. It is more
        frequent in males, 4-5 times as likely to occur. 70% of those with
        autism disorder also have intellectual disabilities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Characteristics-</h4>
      <p>
        Impairment of social relationships, lack of awareness of other’s
        feelings, not liking to be touched, avoiding eye contact, and preferring
        solitary play.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ½ of autistic children don’t properly develop speech; speech is often
        described as an echo of what is being heard.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many focus one object obsessively, having narrow interests in
        activities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cling to stability and routine, many become distraught if change occurs.
        Most engage in self soothing behaviors to block out extra sensory
        information, but do not seem to have a filter to block out irrelevant
        information nor do they have selective attention.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Causes-</h4>
      <p>
        Both genetics and the environment play a role. A number of genes have
        been identified to be associated with the disorder. Studies of those
        with autism have found irregularities in regions of the brain and
        abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-</h4>
      <p>
        A developmental disability that involves a short attention span, high
        distractibility, and difficulty in remaining inactive for periods of
        time. There are 3 subtypes, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive,
        predominately inattentive, and combined hyperactive-impulsive and
        inattentive
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Inattention-</h4>
      <p>
        Easily distracted, miss details, forgets things, and frequently switches
        from different activities. They also have difficulty learning new
        things, staying focused, and completing tasks properly. Don’t seem to
        listen when spoken to, daydream, become easily confused, have difficulty
        processing information, and struggle to follow instructions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hyperactivity-</h4>
      <p>
        Fidget when still, talk nonstop, always moving around and in motion, and
        has difficulty doing quiet tasks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Impulsivity-</h4>
      <p>
        Very impatient, blurting out words, showing emotions without restraint,
        and interrupting others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Causes-</h4>
      <p>A combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Treatment-</h4>
      <p>
        Stimulant drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, and Concerta improve the
        symptoms of the disorder and calming the patient. They do, however, tend
        to have side effects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Related disabilities-</h4>
      <p>
        Learning disability, oppositional defiance disorder, conduct disorder,
        anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar disorder. One disorder doesn’t
        cause another but makes others more noticeable and severe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Oppositional defiant disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Behavior that starts around 8 but can be as early as preschool. Symptoms
        must last for at least 6 months and be more than just a normal childhood
        misbehavior. They include not following requests, being resentful of
        others, arguing with others, blaming others, having few friends, being
        in constant trouble, losing their temper often, being spiteful, and very
        easily annoyed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Behavior is thought to be due to biopsychosocial factors.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conduct disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        A disorder where children tend to be impulsive, hard to control, and
        unconcerned about others. More common among boys. It is associated with
        child abuse, family conflict, genetic defects, poverty, and parental
        drug addiction or alcoholism. Those with antisocial disorder were likely
        diagnosed with conduct disorder as a minor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Symptoms include antisocial behaviors (behaviors that discourage social
        behavior) like bullying and fighting, rule breaking, cruel behavior
        towards others, destruction, heavy drinking/drug use, lying, running
        away, truancy, and vandalism.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with conduct disorder may develop personality disorders as adults,
        particularly antisocial personality disorder, and if it worsens, then it
        could also develop into significant drug and legal problems.
