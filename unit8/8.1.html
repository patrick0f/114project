      <h2>Lesson 8.1 Introduction to Psychological Disorders</h2>
      <p>
        1/4 of adults in the US experiences mental illness in a year. Many
        disorders like depression and schizophrenia exist in all cultures of the
        world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>American psychiatric association-</h4>
      <p>
        Includes the criteria for labelling behavior as disordered: a behavior
        or psychological syndrome that occurs in a person that reflects an
        underlying dysfunction, the consequences of which are distress, pain,
        disability, or impairment. It can’t be just a normal response to
        stressors or loss, but a result of social deviance or conflict.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Deviant-</h4>
      <p>Something that goes against the norm of behavior.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Distressful-</h4>
      <p>Something that causes distress or disturbance.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dysfunctional-</h4>
      <p>Causes harm to self or others.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Unjustifiable-</h4>
      <p>Not reasonable.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>History of disorders-</h4>
      <p>
        Ancient treatments of psychological disorders include trephination,
        exorcism, caging, beating, burning, castration, mutilation, and blood
        transfusion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Trephination-</h4>
      <p>The boring of holes in the skull so as to remove evil forces.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Medical perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Phillipe Pinel insisted that madness wasn’t due to demonic possession
        but due to mind ailments.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Medical model-</h4>
      <p>
        Medical health movement where mental illness was diagnosed on the basis
        of symptoms and treated through therapy, possibly in psychiatric
        hospitals.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biopsychosocial approach-</h4>
      <p>Psychological disorders are created from a combination of factors.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Biological factors are evolution, individual genes, and brain
        structure/chemistry.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychological influences are stress, trauma, learned helplessness, and
        mood related perceptions/memories.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Socio-cultural influences are roles, expectations, and definitions of
        normality and disorder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Psychoanalytic perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes that psychological disorders come from unresolved childhood
        conflicts. To understand disorders, we must look at early life history.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Behavioral perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes that behaviors are learned responses. To understand disorder,
        we must look at how behavior has been learned and what reinforces it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cognitive perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes that thoughts and beliefs are the root of psychological
        problems. The only way to fix behavior is to change thoughts and
        beliefs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Humanistic perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes that people are responsible for their own abnormal behavior.
        Focuses on the relation between people and society and how people see
        themselves in relation to others. Believes that disordered people don’t
        have self-worth but have conditions of worth placed on them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Socio-cultural perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes abnormal behavior is shaped by family, society, and culture.
        One’s relationship with others can cause abnormal behaviors, and the
        stress in life can influence disorders.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Classifying psychological disorders-</h4>
      <p>
        The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders is the source
        of classifying psychological disorders, made by the American psychiatric
        association. It describes 400 disorders in the newest fifth edition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The book has three sections, the introduction, a list of disorders, and
        measures for diagnosis. The DSM aims to describe disorders and indicate
        how prevalent they are. The disorders are reliable, thus diagnosis by
        professionals is consistent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The DSM is criticized for categorizing any kind of behavior in the scope
        of psychiatry. Labels can stigmatize people by assigning them arbitrary
        conditions and judging their value. They can, however, assist in medical
        communication and therapy establishment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Rosenhan’s experiment on being sane in insane places-</h4>
      <p>
        The researcher feigned a mental disorder and admitted himself into a
        psychiatric hospital. They claimed they heard the word thud as a
        symptom. This experiment showed issues about diagnosis in the treatment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Insanity-</h4>
      <p>
        Raises ethical questions about how we should treat those with disorders
        and criminals.
