    <h2>Lesson 8.8 Treatment of Psychological Disorders</h2>
    <h4>History of treatment-</h4>
    <p>
      The treatment of insane people in ancient times was based on irrational
      views, and people were subjected to strange and dangerous treatments.
      Phillipe Pinel and Dorathea Dix founded humane movements to care for
      mentally ill people.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Psychotherapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Involves an emotional, confiding interaction between a therapist and a
      mental patient. There are over 250 types of psychotherapy and therapists
      use eclectic mixes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Biomedical therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Uses drugs that act on the nervous system to cure psychological disorders.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Eclectic approach-</h4>
    <p>Uses healing techniques that vary depending on the client.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Psychoanalysis-</h4>
    <p>
      The first formal psychotherapy developed by Freud. He used the famous
      couch, where patients lay and say whatever comes to mind using free
      association. A therapist’s role is to provide insight and interpret the
      patient’s hidden conflicts.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The aim is to bring repressed feelings into conscious awareness so
      patients can deal with them. Thus, energy devoted to id-ego-superego
      conflict is lessened and so is anxiety.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Resistance-</h4>
    <p>
      The editing of thoughts to resist feelings and express emotions during
      free association. The hesitation shown when asked about something.
      Important in the analysis of conflict driven anxiety.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Transference-</h4>
    <p>
      The transferring and opening up of innermost private thoughts to a
      therapist and therefore developing positive or negative feelings towards
      them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Criticisms-</h4>
    <p>
      Psychoanalysis is hard to refute because it can't be proven/disproven. It
      also takes a long time and can be expensive.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Interpersonal psychotherapy-</h4>
    <p>
      A variation of psychodynamic therapy that treats depression, focusing on
      symptom relief rather than overall personality change.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Humanistic therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Carl Rogers aimed to boost self-fulfillment through helping grow
      self-awareness and self-acceptance.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Person centered therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      A form of humanistic therapy where the therapist listens to the needs of
      the patient and addresses their problems in a productive manner by
      building self-esteem.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Active listening-</h4>
    <p>
      The therapist echoes, restates, and clarifies the patient’s thoughts and
      acknowledges their feelings.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Behavioral/learning therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Therapy that applies learning principles to eliminate unwanted behaviors.
      To treat things, therapists don’t delve beneath the surface to look for
      causes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Changes maladaptive behavior and replaces it for appropriate behaviors.
      Treats most anxiety disorders.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Counterconditioning-</h4>
    <p>
      A classical conditioning procedure that conditions new responses to
      stimuli that trigger unwanted behaviors. Includes exposure therapy and
      aversive conditioning. Getting taught to cry and go fetal in response to a
      snake.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Exposure therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Exposes patients to the things they fear. Repeated exposure lessens
      anxiety due to habituation to the fear.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Systematic desensitization-</h4>
    <p>
      A type of exposure therapy that associates a relaxed state with gradually
      increasing anxiety triggering stimuli used to treat phobias. Creates an
      association between a happy state and a phobia. Slow steps towards a
      phobia. You are shown an image of a snake, then it is brought near you,
      then you hold it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Aversive conditioning-</h4>
    <p>
      A type of counterconditioning that associates unwanted states with
      unwanted behaviors. Temporary conditioned aversion to alcohol has been
      reported with this. Putting a bitter chemical on the nails to discourage
      biting them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Operant conditioning-</h4>
    <p>
      Allows therapists to use behavior modification to reward desired behaviors
      and punish or not reward undesired behaviors. Withdrawn, uncommunicative
      autistic children have been trained by giving and withdrawing
      reinforcements for desired or undesired behaviors.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Token economy-</h4>
    <p>
      Creates a meaningless token used for privileges or treats that can be
      earned through exhibiting a certain behavior. Those in a psych ward are
      given 15 minutes of recess in exchange for keeping quiet for 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Cognitive therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Teaches people adaptive ways of thinking based on the assumption that
      thought intervenes between events and emotional reactions. Helps get rid
      of bad, negative thoughts. You get fired and you believe you’re worthless,
      so you get depressed. You get fired and you believe you can do greater
      things, so you don’t get depressed.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Depression-</h4>
    <p>
      Aaron Beck and Aaron Ellis suggest that depressed patients don’t think
      they could ever be happy and thus associate minor fails, like failing a
      test, as major causes for depression. They believed that these thoughts
      needed to change for a patient to recover and used gentle questioning to
      do so.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Depressed patients were told to record daily positive events and show how
      they contributed to the events to display how they had control over
      positive things in life. These patients showed lower depression scores
      compared to other depressed patients.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Cognitive behavior therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Combines the reversal of negative thoughts with the modification of
      behavior. Aims to alter the way people act, behavior therapy, and the way
      they think, cognitive therapy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Rational emotive behavior therapy</h4>
    <p>
      Helps individuals see their false ways of thinking in a direct and
      confrontational way. The most controversial types of therapies because it
      tells people that they are wrong, and they should change.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Group therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      Consist of 6-9 people in a session so more people can be helped for a
      lower cost. Clients benefit from the knowledge that others have similar
      problems as them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Family therapy-</h4>
    <p>
      A family together working with a clinician to improve communication and
      resolve conflicts.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Antipsychotic drugs-</h4>
    <p>
      Comes in chlorpromazine, or Thorazine, clozapine, or Clozaril, Seroquel,
      Risperdal, and Zyprexa, which block serotonin and dopamine. Most of these
      medicines/drugs block dopamine receptors, working as antagonists. Side
      effects include sluggishness, tics/involuntary body movements (tardive
      dyskinesia), lowering of white blood cells, and weight gain. Treats
      schizophrenia.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Tardive dyskinesia-</h4>
    <p>Mild to severe twitching, shaking, or jerking in the body.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Antimanic drugs-</h4>
    <p>
      Comes in lithium, or lithium carbonate, anticonvulsant meds, and Depakote.
      These medicines reduce manic activity. Doses have to be controlled because
      lithium is powerful and can easily become toxic. Treats bipolar disorder.
      Bipolar lithium.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Antidepressant drugs-</h4>
    <p>
      Comes in SSRIs such as Prozac, Zoloft, celexa, and Lexapro, or SNRIs such
      as Effexor and Cymbalta. SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin and SNRIs block
      reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Side effects include dry mouth,
      constipation, headaches, and weight gain.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Antianxiety drugs-</h4>
    <p>
      Comes in benzodiazepines including Librium, valium, Ativan, and Xanax.
      These medicines work to reduce the anxiety of responses to stimuli that
      signal punishment and frustration. Used for a short time due to dependency
      risks. Side effects include drowsiness, reduced concentration, lethargy,
      and physical dependence. Treats OCD, GAD, phobias, etc.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>ECT (electroconvulsive therapy)-</h4>
    <p>
      Used to treat severe depression by passing currents through the brain
      using 2 electrodes. Resets the hypothalamus and readjusts hormone levels.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Psychosurgery-</h4>
    <p>
      A lobotomy where the nerves between the frontal lobe and center of inner
      brain structures are severed. Side effects include permanent lethargy,
      immaturity, and an impulsive personality.
