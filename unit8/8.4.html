      <h2>Lesson 8.4 Anxiety, OCD, and Trauma Related Disorders</h2>
      <p>
        Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the US. Anxiety
        used to be a large all-encompassing umbrella for disorders in the DSMIV
        but is now counted separately in the DSMV from obsessive compulsive
        disorders and trauma/stress related PTSD disorders.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Anxiety disorders-</h4>
      <p>
        General qualities include worry, fear, apprehension, intrusive thoughts,
        physical symptoms, and feelings of tension. These have an automatic
        quality that comes from within, like an uncontrollable reaction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>General anxiety disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Prolonged, vague, but intense fears that aren’t attached to any
        particular object. 4-6% of the population experiences GAD, and it is
        more common in women and starts showing in young adults.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Symptoms include excessive anxiety for at least 6 months, inability to
        control worry, considerable impairment in important parts of life, and
        other symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, loose concentration,
        irritability, and tension.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Panic disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Indicators are similar to GAD, but more magnified and spontaneous.
        Disorder is more common among women and young people. Clinical features
        include recurring, unexpected panic attacks that last for a month and a
        constant worry of having them again. Symptoms include shortness of
        breath, dizziness, trembling, sweating, racing heart, choking, nausea,
        numbness, chest pain, and a sense of going crazy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Phobia-</h4>
      <p>
        Marked by a persistent and irrational fear of an object or situation
        that disrupts behavior. Common fears include animals, heights, blood,
        and close spaces. People with phobias know what they are afraid of, but
        their fear is unproportionate with reality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Specific phobia-</h4>
      <p>Fear of an object, such as spiders or closed spaces.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social phobia-</h4>
      <p>Fear of embarrassment in interaction with others.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Agoraphobia-</h4>
      <p>
        Fear of fearful events and fear itself, often accompanied by panic
        attacks. People with this phobia might not even leave their home in
        fear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Obsessive compulsive disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        The persistence of unwanted intrusive thoughts, obsessions, and the urge
        to engage in senseless rituals, compulsions, that cause distress. These
        compulsions act to alleviate the obsessions. A person has an obsession
        or intrusive thought, followed by anxiety or stress, and thus carries
        out a ritual, which brings relief. This repeats in a cycle. Those with
        OCD don’t trust their own sense, so they repeat their compulsions over
        and over. A biological psychologist would say that the frontal lobe is
        affected by OCD. PET scans of OCD patients show high metabolic activity
        in the frontal lobe areas that are involved with attention.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Body dysmorphic disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        An OCD related disorder that used to be considered a somatoform disorder
        because it was of the body, along with trichotillomania and excoriation
        disorder. A preoccupation or belief in an imagined or exaggerated defect
        in personal appearance. It is often about the shape of facial features,
        skin blemishes, or thinning hair. BDD patients experience great stress
        or self-consciousness over this deformity. It becomes evident in
        adolescence and affects both genders equally.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hoarding disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        An OCD related disorder where there is a difficulty with discarding
        possessions because of a need to save them and a sense of distress at
        the thought of getting rid of items.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Trichotillomania-</h4>
      <p>
        An OCD related disorder where there is a hair pulling disorder that
        involves recurrent, irresistible urges to pull out hair from the body.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Excoriation disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        An OCD related disorder with a skin picking disorder where one
        repeatedly picks at the skin, resulting in lesions and disruption to
        life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Post-traumatic stress disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Four or more weeks of experiences haunting memories, nightmares,
        flashbacks, social withdrawal, jump anxiety, and sleep problems can
        constitute PTSD.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A common prototype for PTSD is a soldier, but anyone who experiences
        trauma can get PTSD.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        10% of women and 20% of men who experience trauma develop PTSD.
        Holocaust survivors have shown resilience against traumatic situations,
        but PTSD is still common among them. PTSD can also be caused by
        non-combat related trauma such as sexual or physical abuse, car
        accidents, natural disasters, and even medical procedures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Acute stress disorder-</h4>
      <p>
        Very similar to PTSD but starts immediately after the trauma and lasts
        up to a month. PTSD and acute stress disorder were previously considered
        anxiety disorders, but not anymore due to patients not always
        experiencing anxiety.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Learning perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Fear conditioning leads to anxiety, which gets associated with other
        objects due to stimulus generalization and reinforced thereafter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biological perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD are linked with brain circuits like the
        anterior cingulate cortex.
