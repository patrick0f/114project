      <h2>Lesson 9.2 Social Influences</h2>
      <h4>Social influence-</h4>
      <p>How the actions of others shape the way we think/behave.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social roles-</h4>
      <p>
        Socially defined patterns of behavior expected of people in a setting.
        Prescribes behavior by saying what to do, how to do it, and when. The
        roles people assume can result from their interests or goals, but also
        by cultural economic, or biological conditions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social norms-</h4>
      <p>
        A group’s expectations about what is appropriate and acceptable for its
        member’s attitudes and behaviors. It can be broad, like certain
        political views or narrow like having to raise your hand to speak. How
        you greet others is a different social norm in different cultures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conformity-</h4>
      <p>Adjusting one’s behavior to coincide with the group standard.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We follow other’s behaviors to conform. The spectrum goes from
        conformity to compliance to obedience, from least to most extreme
        guidance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Conditions that influence conformity include the size of the group,
        status of the group, observation of the group, and unanimity of the
        group.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Solomon Asch-</h4>
      <p>
        Conducted a line experiment to test levels of conformity. Individual
        participants would sit with other pseudo participants who would give the
        wrong answer collectively to see if the actual participant would conform
        or not. 1/3 of participants conformed to the unanimous group regularly,
        and ¾ conformed at least once.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Normative social influence-</h4>
      <p>
        You want to avoid rejection or gain approval, so you respect the norms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Informative social influence-</h4>
      <p>
        The group may provide valuable info, so you try to accept their
        opinions, especially in tough decisions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Compliance-</h4>
      <p>
        Adjusting behavior because of a request. Explicit is a direct request,
        implicit is an indirect request. Implicit compliance is often used by
        politicians or salesmen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Obedience-</h4>
      <p>A change in behavior in response to the command of an authority.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Milgram’s shock experiment-</h4>
      <p>
        Stanley Milgram designed a study that investigated how authority affects
        obedience. An experimenter, an actor, and a participant went in a room
        where the actor would get hooked into a shock machine. It tested how far
        the participant would go to shock someone because an authority figure
        (experimenter) told them to. 65% of participants went all the way to
        shock actors for 450 volts.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        People rationalized their obedience because they felt the experimenter
        was responsible for what happened to the other person. The prestige of
        an authority figure makes it harder to disobey. The presence of others
        that disobey brings down obedience. Personality of the person also
        changes obedience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social dilemmas-</h4>
      <p>
        Situations where selfish behavior that benefits people in the short term
        will cause disaster for the group in the long term. A person can either
        rat out his friend and get off free or keep quiet and both receive a
        smaller punishment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social facilitation-</h4>
      <p>
        The improved performance of task in the presence of others. Playing a
        sport better in the presence of a friend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social loafing-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency for people in a group to be less effortful compared to when
        they are an individual. They feel less accountable in a group and see
        contribution as less important.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Deindividuation-</h4>
      <p>
        Mob mentality or the loss of self-awareness and restraint in a group
        situation that has anonymity and a fervorous atmosphere. Nobody can be
        singled out, so people feel generally less accountable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Group polarization-</h4>
      <p>
        Enhances prevailing attitudes in group discussion. A like-minded group
        will strengthen the prevailing opinions. It can be beneficial or
        harmful, but most generally leave energized and passionate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Group thinking-</h4>
      <p>
        A way of thinking that occurs when the desire for harmony in decision
        making overrides the alternatives. The general consensus prevails, and
        the minority’s voice is blocked out.
