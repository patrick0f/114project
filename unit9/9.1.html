      <h2>Lesson 9.1 Social Thinking</h2>
      <p>
        The study of how we think about, influence, and relate to each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social cognition-</h4>
      <p>
        The mental processes associated with the way people perceive and react
        to others. Each person has a unique perception of reality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Attribution-</h4>
      <p>
        The process of explaining the causes of behavior, including one's own,
        by crediting the external situation/factors or the internal disposition
        or personality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Situational attribution-</h4>
      <p>
        External factors that contribute to something. Getting a good night’s
        sleep before a test to score well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dispositional attribution-</h4>
      <p>
        Internal factors that contribute to something. Scoring well on a test
        because of high intelligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fundamental attribution error-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to over attribute the behavior of others to internal
        dispositional factors like personality traits. We are more aware of how
        our behavior changes with the situations encountered than personality
        traits alone. Blaming others for something you just did yourself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-serving bias-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to attribute success to internal factors, disposition, and
        failures to external factors, situation. Comes into play when committing
        a fundamental attribution error.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Attitude-</h4>
      <p>
        Beliefs and feelings that predispose reactions to things. They are made
        up of 3 components.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cognitive component is the beliefs about the attribute of an object.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>An effective component is the feelings about the object.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Behavioral is the way people act towards objects.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If someone is nice (cognitive), we feel kindness (affective) and act in
        a friendly way (behavioral).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Attitudes influence actions and decisions.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Central route of persuasion-</h4>
      <p>
        Attitudes directly change when interested people focus on the scientific
        evidence argument and respond with favorable thoughts. Choosing a credit
        card because of its great benefits and low fees.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Peripheral route of persuasion-</h4>
      <p>
        Attitudes indirectly change when people make snap judgements on
        incidental cues. Choosing a credit card because of an attractive model
        on television.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Actions- Attitudes influence actions if outside influences on our
        actions are minimal. We generally follow our attitudes when
        unrestrained.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If the attitude is relevant to the behavior, the two will match more
        likely. When you don’t like a food, you don’t eat it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>If we are aware of our attitudes, we are true to ourselves.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Actions can also influence attitudes.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Foot in the door phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency for people to agree with smaller requests, and then a
        larger one later on. People find it hard to say no when they have
        already agreed to a few smaller things.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Door in the face phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        Asking for a big favor and then after being turned down, asking for
        something smaller. Because of the seemingness to compromise and the
        smaller intensity of request, the second smaller request is more likely
        to be granted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cognitive dissonance theory-</h4>
      <p>
        When people become aware of the inconsistencies or dissonance between
        their attitudes and behavior, they become anxious and strive to make
        them consistent, thought of by Leon Festinger.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Often, beliefs or attitudes are changed to match the behavior.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stanford prison experiment-</h4>
      <p>
        It showed the impact of the situation on behavior, done by Philip
        Zimbardo.
