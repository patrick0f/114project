      <h2>Lesson 9.5 Socio-cultural Impacts on the Self</h2>
      <h4>Self-concept-</h4>
      <p>
        One’s sense of self. Compared with the norms of society. A girl calls
        herself a tomboy because she likes things that boys like, such as
        sports.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Norms-</h4>
      <p>
        Society’s standards of behavior. Girls like dolls and behave lady like.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Norms in an individualistic culture would be to be very independent and
        self-centered. In a collectivist culture, having personal goals and
        leaving the family would not be honored.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Kenneth Clark-</h4>
      <p>
        For the Brown vs Board of education case, Clark and his wife did a doll
        test experiment to see the effects of segregation on black children.
        They placed two nearly identical dolls with the only difference being
        their skin color in front of children and asked them moral questions
        such as which was better or nicer. Black children considered themselves
        inferior and beneath white children, due to prejudice and
        discrimination.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stereotype threat-</h4>
      <p>
        A self-confirming concern that you will be evaluated based on a negative
        stereotype. All in one’s own mind. In the blue/brown eye experiment,
        those in the brown eye group would self-confirm the fact that they were
        in the inferior group.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-fulfilling prophecy-</h4>
      <p>
        A belief that leads to its own fulfillment. Social and cultural groups
        of other people lead us to think in a certain way. A woman takes a test
        and believes so deeply that they will fail that they actually end up
        failing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We behave towards others in ways that influence them to behave in ways
        that justify our beliefs about them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conflict-</h4>
      <p>
        A perceived incompatibility of actions, goals, or ideas. They can cause
        a destructive cycle with social traps and distorted perceptions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social traps-</h4>
      <p>
        Situations where the pursuit of personal interest overtakes the
        importance of collective well-being.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Mirror image perception-</h4>
      <p>
        Seeing someone as untrustworthy and evil, so they see you that way as
        well.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3 class="vocab">Other Important Vocabulary</h3>
      <h4>Superordinate goals-</h4>
      <p>
        Shared goals that override differences among people and require
        cooperation. The UN pledged to end world hunger within the next century,
        requiring the help of all members globally.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>GRIT-</h4>
      <p>A strategy to reduce international tensions.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Other race effect-</h4>
      <p>The tendency to recall the faces of one's own race better.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Personal space-</h4>
      <p>The buffer zone around the body</p>
