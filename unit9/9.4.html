      <h2>Lesson 9.4 Positive Social Influences</h2>
      <h4>Altruism-</h4>
      <p>Unselfish regard for the welfare of others.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social exchange theory-</h4>
      <p>
        The decision to help others is based on how much it costs for oneself
        compared to how much it will help the receiver, like a risk to reward
        ratio.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reciprocity norm-</h4>
      <p>We should return help and not harm those who help us.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social responsibility norm-</h4>
      <p>
        A learned norm that tells us to help when others need it even though
        they might not repay us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Clarity for need of help-</h4>
      <p>
        The more obvious that help is needed, the more likely that help will be
        provided. If a car collision occurs, people will help immediately
        because it is very obvious.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Kitty Genovese-</h4>
      <p>
        A woman was walking home and got stabbed and attacked for 30 minutes.
        Many people witnessed this attack but did nothing to help her.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Diffusion of responsibility-</h4>
      <p>
        If more people are present, the responsibility to help will spread among
        everyone present.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bystander effect-</h4>
      <p>
        As the number of people present increases, the likelihood of any one
        person coming up to help will decrease.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Feel-good do-good phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency for people to be more helpful when they themselves are in a
        good mood.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Other factors also include the personality of the helper, their current
        task at hand, the weather, being in a smaller/less busy environment, and
        if someone else was just being helpful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Empathy altruism theory-</h4>
      <p>
        People help for altruistic reasons and are motivated to increase other’s
        well-being depending on how much empathy they have for that person.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Evolutionary theory-</h4>
      <p>
        People help their relatives because it increases the chances of their
        genes being passed on and surviving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Attraction-</h4>
      <p>
        Proximity and geographic location are a strong indicator of friendship.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Mere-exposure effect-</h4>
      <p>
        Repeated exposure to novel stimuli will increase one’s liking of an
        item. The more one is around a new person, the more they will grow to
        like them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Environment-</h4>
      <p>
        The circumstances under which people first meet influences attraction.
        People are more likely to be attracted if they meet in comfortable
        conditions because attraction is more likely when associated with
        pleasant thoughts.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Similarity-</h4>
      <p>
        Having similar views causes attraction to strengthen. This means similar
        views in terms of religion, politics, and familial values.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Matching hypothesis-</h4>
      <p>
        People date and form relationships with those similar in attractiveness
        levels. We are attracted by physical qualities in the initial stages of
        a relationship. We pair with those similar in attractiveness because we
        compromise; we are afraid of being rejected by those we see as more
        attractive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intimate relationships-</h4>
      <p>A relationship has stages that partners will go through.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Passionate love-</h4>
      <p>
        An aroused state of intensive positive absorption in another at the
        beginning of a relationship when one is consumed with thoughts of the
        other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Compassionate love-</h4>
      <p>
        Deep and affectionate attachment marked by mutual concern for the
        welfare of the partner. What is left when passion dissipates. It is less
        arousing but psychologically more intimate compared to passionate love.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Equity-</h4>
      <p>When one receives what they give to the relationship.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-disclosure-</h4>
      <p>Revealing intimate details about oneself.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sternberg’s triangular theory of love-</h4>
      <p>
        The three main components are liking/intimacy, empty love/commitment,
        and infatuation/passion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Passion and intimacy create romantic love, intimacy and commitment
        create companionship, and passion and commitment create fatuous love.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>With all three together, consummate love is made.</p>
