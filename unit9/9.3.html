      <h2>Lesson 9.3 Negative Social Influences</h2>
      <h4>Prejudice-</h4>
      <p>
        Also called prejudgment, an unjustifiable, negative attitude towards a
        group, often of different backgrounds. Composed of beliefs, stereotypes,
        emotions, and predispositions to act.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Works at the conscious and more unconscious levels, like a knee jerk
        response rather than a decision.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Causes include social inequality, division, identity, thought patterns,
        and emotional scapegoating.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Ingroup-</h4>
      <p>
        People that share a common identity with someone. Can be family,
        friends, ethnic group, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Outgroup-</h4>
      <p>Those seen as different from the ingroup.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Ingroup bias-</h4>
      <p>The tendency to favor one’s own group/ingroup.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Jane Elliot-</h4>
      <p>
        Discriminated against brown and blue-eyed students. She identified the
        brown eyed students as inferior, causing friends to turn on each other.
        She did the same for the blue-eyed students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Scapegoat theory-</h4>
      <p>
        When prejudice is an outlet for anger to blame someone. Nazis blamed
        Jews for the years of economic despair as a scapegoat. Arabs were lashed
        out against after 9/11.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cognitive roots-</h4>
      <p>
        The brain uses shortcuts for everything, so it categorizes people into
        easily identifiable traits, like looks. We stereotype those groups based
        on previous experiences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Just world phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        Good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.
        People get what they deserve, which is victim blaming.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Contact hypothesis-</h4>
      <p>
        Stereotypes and prejudice against a group will diminish as contact with
        them increases. This is only part of the solution; educational
        techniques must also be used to address social cognitions and
        perceptions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Aggression-</h4>
      <p>
        A range of behaviors that result in physical and psychological harm to
        others/oneself.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Genetic influences-</h4>
      <p>
        Animals have been bred for aggressiveness. Twin studies show that
        aggression may be genetic and is possibly linked to the male Y
        chromosome.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Neural influences-</h4>
      <p>
        The limbic system, amygdala, and frontal lobe are involved in
        aggression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biochemical influences-</h4>
      <p>
        Animals that see decreased testosterone through castration become
        docile. Testosterone injections also increase aggression levels.
        Prenatal testosterone exposure also increases aggression in female
        hyenas.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cultural influences-</h4>
      <p>
        When aggression leads to a desired outcome, one learns to be aggressive,
        which is seen more in individualist cultures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Frustration aggression principle-</h4>
      <p>
        Frustration creates anger, which leads to aggression. This means people
        won’t be aggressive unless they are frustrated. Researchers agree that
        the direct cause of most aggression is a negative emotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Excitation transfer-</h4>
      <p>
        Arousal from an experience can carry over to another situation. This new
        situation must trigger aggression. After running a mile, you discover
        your car got pooped on, so you respond aggressively due to your already
        heightened state.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Aversive events and people-</h4>
      <p>Those that are miserable often make others miserable.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stressful environments-</h4>
      <p>
        High temperatures, air pollution, and noise have been shown to increase
        aggressive tendencies.
