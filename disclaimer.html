      <h2>About the Site</h2>
      <p>
        The contents of this site, including the assessment questions, were all
        found online through websites such as Quizlet and Quizizz. The actual
        lesson content was largely inspired by Mandy Rice's AP Psychology Videos
        on YouTube. This website merely acts as a convenient gathering place for
        the information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notes are formatted in a paraphrased way, meaning that they are, for
        the most part, worded concisely, but there will be examples and
        pictures.
      </p>
      <p>*** The FRQs are taken directly from College Board's website.</p>

      <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <p>
        The unit assessments are 30 question tests that can be retaken as many
        times as possible (there will be different questions every time).
      </p>
      <p>
        The final assessment is a 100 question test that uses questions from all
        the unit tests combined, and it can also be retaken as many times as
        needed (again, different questions each time).
