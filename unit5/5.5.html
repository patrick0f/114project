      <h2>Lesson 5.5 Forgetting</h2>
      <h4>Forgetting-</h4>
      <p>
        The inability to retrieve information due to poor encoding, storage, or
        retrieval.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Encoding failure-</h4>
      <p>
        When we cannot remember what we did not encode. We can’t remember what
        wasn’t there in the first place.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Storage decay-</h4>
      <p>
        Poor durability of stored memories leads to decay, not deletion.
        Ebbinghaus showed this with a forgetting curve with a large drop in the
        retention of information, but it evens out over time. This is believed
        to be due to the gradual fading of the memory trace in the brain, the
        connections aren’t as strong as when first learned.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Barrick showed a pattern similar to that of Ebbinghaus with forgetting
        and retention of Spanish vocabular over 50 years.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Retrieval failure-</h4>
      <p>
        Although the info is retained in memory storage, it cannot be accessed.
        Tip of the tongue is retrieval failure phenomenon. You know it is there,
        you just can’t bring it out of storage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Interference-</h4>
      <p>Learning some info may disrupt the retrieval of other information.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Proactive interference-</h4>
      <p>
        Old info interferes with remembering new info. Old info blocks the
        retrieval of new info. You get a new number, but still give out the old
        one when asked for it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Retroactive interference-</h4>
      <p>
        Learning new information interferes with recalling old info. New info
        blocks the retrieval of old info. You forget how to do a geometry
        question while in calculus class.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sleep helps to avoid retroactive interference thus leading to better
        recall, so studying before going to bed for a test is a good idea.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Motivated forgetting-</h4>
      <p>
        People unknowingly revise their memories; we don’t remember things we
        don’t want to remember.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Repression-</h4>
      <p>
        Defense mechanism that gets rid of anxiety arousing thoughts, feelings,
        and memories from the conscious mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reasons to forget-</h4>
      <p>
        Forgetting can occur at any stage. Some memory loss is due to factors
        other than forgetting, it can be due to structural damage to the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Amnesia-</h4>
      <p>
        Partial or complete loss of memory due to physical or psychological
        factors. Damage to a part of the brain due to Alzheimer’s disease, a
        stroke, or any kind of brain trauma are physical causes. A traumatic
        event is a possible psychological factor. With this, memories are
        usually returned over a few days of time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Anterograde amnesia-</h4>
      <p>
        Memory loss for items after the trauma causing amnesia. The inability to
        remember ongoing events after the incidence of trauma or the onset of
        the disease that caused the amnesia. Ante-after.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Retrograde amnesia-</h4>
      <p>
        The inability to remember events that occurred before the incidence of
        the trauma or the onset of the disease that caused the amnesia.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Memory construction-</h4>
      <p>
        While trying to remember things, we filter or fill in missing pieces of
        info to make recall more coherent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Misinformation effect-</h4>
      <p>
        Incorporating misleading information into one’s memory of an event. The
        brain doesn’t do this to be deceitful, it just likes nice, neat, and
        complete pictures so it fills in the gaps unconsciously.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Source amnesia-</h4>
      <p>
        Attributing an event to the wrong source we have experienced. Forgetting
        where you learned something.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>True vs false memories-</h4>
      <p>
        Real memories or memories that seem real are difficult to discern, so
        just because a memory feels real doesn’t mean it is. The brain can tell
        the difference between real and false memories, but we cannot. If
        something was never heard, there wouldn’t be a sensory record to be
        activated in the temporal lobe, so if the brain was analyzed when you
        were thinking about a false fact, the temporal lobe wouldn’t be
        activated.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Constructed memories-</h4>
      <p>
        Elizabeth Loftus conducted much research on this area. She contacted the
        parents of college students and asked for a list of childhood events
        that the students were asked to recall. Plausible events were added to
        the list that never happened. After repeated recall attempts, many
        students claimed to remember the false events inserted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Eyewitness testimonies-</h4>
      <p>
        Eyewitness testimonies are often full of error, but it is still one of
        the main methods to gain info about crimes. People’s collections are
        less influenced by leading questions if they are warned that the
        questions could create memory bias. Time allows for memories to fade, so
        it is better to ask right away for the clearest details. Younger
        children and adults over 65 can be susceptible to misinformation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Improving memory-</h4>
      <p>
        Study repeatedly to boost recall, spend more time rehearsing or thinking
        about material, make the material more personally meaningful, use
        mnemonic devices, activate retrieval cues to mentally recreate the
        situation and mood, recall events when they are fresh and before
        encountering misinformation, minimize interference.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Metacognition-</h4>
      <p>Knowing what you know.</p>
