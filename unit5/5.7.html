      <h2>Lesson 5.7 Introduction to Intelligence</h2>
      <h4>Intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The capacity to understand the world, think rationally, and use
        resources efficiently. In research studies, intelligence is what the
        intelligence tests measures, usually school smarts.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conceptual difficulties-</h4>
      <p>Psychologists think of intelligence as a concept and not an object.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reification-</h4>
      <p>
        Viewing an abstract immaterial concept as if it were a concrete thing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Controversy-</h4>
      <p>
        Is intelligence a single overall ability or several specific abilities?
        Can we locate and measure intelligence in the brain with modern
        neuroscience?
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>General intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        Charles Spearman believed there was a single general factor for all
        mental ability. He didn’t deny that some people have outstanding
        talents, but he still felt that differences shouldn’t take away from one
        general intelligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Spearman proposed that general intelligence is linked to many clusters
        that can be analyzed by factor analysis that create a single underlying
        aspect of intelligence. People that do well on vocabulary and writing
        comprehension are part of a cluster that defines verbal intelligence.
        Other general factors are spatial ability and reasoning ability.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>LL Thurstone-</h4>
      <p>
        LL Thurstone analyzed subjects on 7 clusters of primary mental abilities
        including word fluency, verbal comprehension, spatial ability,
        perceptual speed, numerical ability, inductive reasoning, and memory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychologists analyzed Thurstone’s data and a persistent tendency
        between these clusters was shown. Those who excelled in one area scored
        well on others, which suggested the existence of a g-factor that
        underlies all intelligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Howard Gardner-</h4>
      <p>
        Supports Thurstone’s idea that intelligence comes in multiple forms.
        Gardener notes that brain damage may diminish one type of ability but
        not others, so there has to be many parts of intelligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Gardener believes in 9 different forms of independent intelligence.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Verbal/linguistic intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The capacity to use language to express yourself and understand others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Logical/mathematical intelligence-</h4>
      <p>The ability to understand the principles of a causal system</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Visual/spatial intelligence-</h4>
      <p>The ability to present the spatial world internally in the mind.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Musical/rhythmic intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The capacity to think in music, be able to hear patterns, recognize, and
        manipulate them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bodily/ kinesthetic intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The capacity to use the body to solve a problem, make something, or make
        a production.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Naturalist intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The ability to discriminate among living things and to be sensitive to
        features of the natural world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intrapersonal intelligence-</h4>
      <p>Understanding yourself, who you are, and what you can do.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Interpersonal intelligence-</h4>
      <p>The ability to understand others.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Existential intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to pose questions and ponder about life, death, and
        reality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Robert Sternberg-</h4>
      <p>
        Suggests a triarchic theory with three intelligences rather than eight.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Analytical intelligence-</h4>
      <p>Assessed by intelligence tests.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Creative intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        Intelligence that makes us adapt to novel situations and generate new
        ideas.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Practical intelligence-</h4>
      <p>Intelligence required for everyday tasks.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sternberg proposed seven types of people based on this combination of
        intelligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Analyzers are good in academic environments but are poor in creative
        contributions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Creators generate new ideas well but are unable to analyze these ideas
        or put them into practice.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Practitioners are persuasive and maybe entertaining but lack substance
        in thinking.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Analytical creators are able to analyze created ideas but can’t easily
        communicate these ideas to others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Creative practitioners can come up with new ideas and persuade others of
        their value, regardless of if they are worth it or not.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Consummate balancers are able to apply all three intelligences as needed
        and are able to make contributions wherever.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Emotional intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        Daniel Goleman believes that emotional intelligence, or EQ, is a set of
        skills that are part of the assessment, evaluation, expression, and
        regulation of emotions. This aspect of intelligence is about getting
        along well with others and shows people can be successful due to a high
        EQ because they can read others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>There are components of EQ.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perceive emotion-</h4>
      <p>Recognizing emotion in faces, music, and stories.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Understand emotion-</h4>
      <p>Predict emotions, how they change and blend.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Manage emotion-</h4>
      <p>Express emotions in different situations</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Use emotion-</h4>
      <p>Using emotions to adapt or be creative.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        EQ has yet to be quantified and tested. Many believe EQ shouldn’t be
        taught by anyone other than families.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Creativity-</h4>
      <p>
        The ability to produce ideas that are novel and valuable. Correlates
        with intelligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Expertise-</h4>
      <p>A well-developed knowledge base.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Imaginative thinking-</h4>
      <p>The ability to see things in new ways</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Adventuresome personality-</h4>
      <p>Seeking new experiences.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intrinsic motivation-</h4>
      <p>Motivated to be creative within</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Creative environment-</h4>
      <p>A creative and supportive environment.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Measuring intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        Studies show a +.40 correlation between brain size and intelligence. As
        brain size decreases with age, scores on verbal intelligence decrease.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Brain function-</h4>
      <p>
        People who score high on intelligence tests perceive stimuli faster,
        retrieve info quickly, and show faster response times.
