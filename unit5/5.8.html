      <h2>Lesson 5.8 Levels of Intellect</h2>
      <h4>Levels of intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The intellectually disabled have an IQ of 70 or lower. High intelligence
        is 135 IQ and higher.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intellectual disability-</h4>
      <p>
        Having significantly below average intellectual functioning and
        limitations in at least two areas of adaptive functioning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Adaptive functioning includes communication skills, self-care, ability
        to be independent, social skills, community involvement, self-direction,
        health and safety, academics, and leisure and work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Causes include genetics (down syndrome, those with an extra chromosome),
        environmental factors (fetal alcohol syndrome, sbs), deprivation or
        neglect, and other unknown causes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There is no cure, but there are some types of preventative measures for
        intellectual disability. A test can be performed on newborns for a
        hidden genetic disorder called PKU, and if detected early, can be
        prevented with a special diet (no protein). General counseling,
        pregnancy care services, and education of new parents are other
        preventative strategies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Levels of disability-</h4>
      <p>
        Those with mild disability have an IQ of 50-70 and encompass 85% of
        those disabled. Their academic abilities are at a 6th grade level, but
        they can learn to be independent and have a job.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with moderate disability have an IQ of 35-49 and have academic
        abilities at a second-grade level. They can be trained in self-care and
        acquire reading/writing skills but do require supervision.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with severe disability have an IQ of 20-34 and have the mental
        capacity of a 5 year old. They can learn to talk and perform simple
        tasks but require close supervision.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with profound disabilities have an IQ below 20 and a mental age of
        less than 3. They have limited communication and need constant
        supervision, typically with many physical disabilities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intellectually gifted-</h4>
      <p>
        Most research on giftedness was done by Lewis Terman, and the resulting
        data is much of what we know about the subject. He found that most
        gifted children excelled in school, had good health, and were happy
        overall. Most went on the path of success, but most lived an ordinary
        life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Genetics and environment-</h4>
      <p>
        The most passionately followed question in psychology is if intelligence
        is due to genetics or the environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Studies of family members, twins, and adopted children support the idea
        that there is a significant genetic contribution to intelligence. Those
        raised together and more genetically related had higher correlated IQ.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Genetic influences-</h4>
      <p>
        James Bouchard came across two twins separated at birth that lived
        remarkably similar lives. He studied over 100 pairs of twins separated
        at birth that had similar personalities, temperament, intelligence, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Adopted children have more similar IQ to their biological parents than
        their adoptive ones.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Research from the human genome project has also suggested intelligence
        has a genetic role. The genetic basis of intelligence is complicated,
        however, because it involves the interaction of many genes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Schooling effects-</h4>
      <p>Increased schooling is related to higher intelligence scores.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Environment on intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        The different races (white, black, Asian) are very similar genetically,
        as it is a social category, not a genetic one. Todayâ€™s better prepared
        students outperform populations of the 1930s due to the Flynn effect. In
        different eras, different ethnic groups have experienced periods of
        achievement, meaning no one group is superior to others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Genie Wiley was a child in the 1960s found at 13 years old and locked in
        her room from birth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Heritability-</h4>
      <p>
        The amount of trait variation within a group that can be attributed to
        genetic differences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Heritability and heredity are not the same. Heritability looks at the
        differences in groups of people while heredity looks at inherited
        individual traits. Heritable differences are with a group sharing the
        same environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Heritability is highest in groups who share the same environment but
        have different genes.
