    <h2>Lesson 5.3 Storage</h2>
    <p>The heart of memory is storage.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Long term memory-</h4>
    <p>
      Unlimited capacity to store information. It is estimated that the capacity
      ranges from 1,000-1,000,000 billion bits of information.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Not remembering pieces of information like who is on the front of a
      20-dollar bill is an example of an encoding error.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Sorting memories-</h4>
    <p>
      Penfield concluded through electrical stimulation of the brain that old
      memories were etched into the brain.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Loftus reviewed this data and showed that only a handful of brain
      stimulated patients reported flashbacks.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Lashley using rats, suggested that even after removing arts of the brain
      animals retained part of the memories of the maze.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Memory trace-</h4>
    <p>
      Engram is the biological basis of long-term memory. It looks on the level
      of synapses and biochemical changes that are believed to represent the
      physical memory trace in nerve cells. It also looks for neural circuitry
      used by memory in the brain.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Synaptic changes-</h4>
    <p>
      Long term memories form at the synapse as fragile chemical traces that
      slowly consolidate into more permanent synaptic changes over time. The
      more we use synapses, the stronger the memory.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Neural circuitry-</h4>
    <p>
      Research began by looking at individuals that had parts of the brain
      removed in botched operations.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Patient HM had surgery for epileptic seizures, removing his hippocampus
      and amygdala on both sides of the brain. Since the surgery, he has been
      unable to create new memories although his memories of events prior to the
      operation remain normal. It shows that the neural circuitry we develop as
      we learn things stays even when parts of the brain disappear.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Brain structure involved in memory-</h4>
    <p>
      Hippocampus encodes and transfers new explicit memories to long term
      memory and aids in the initial encoding of information.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Cerebellum has memories involving movement.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Temporal lobe encodes and transfers new explicit memories to long term
      memory.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Amygdala encodes emotional aspects of memories. It strengthens memories
      that have strong emotional associations. These emotional connections aid
      access and retrieval. The amygdala is likely responsible for the memories
      associated with PTSD.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The prefrontal cortex has memories involving the sequences of events, but
      not the events themselves.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>The cerebral cortex changes memories into more permanent ones.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Storage areas-</h4>
    <p>
      There isn’t any one place where memories are stored, they are spread out
      into neural networks all over the brain. It also depends on the material
      being learned. Storage appears to be linked to areas in the brain where
      the processing of the info occurs. Visual information memories would be
      stored in the visual cortex.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Heightened emotions create stronger memories. Stress seems to boost
      activity in the brain’s memory forming areas. Continued stress can disrupt
      memory.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Implicit memories-</h4>
    <p>
      Memories not consciously aware of but can affect behavior. Includes
      memories of skills like riding a bike and driving a car. You can dislike
      someone you met for the first time and dislike them because the implicit
      memory can remind you of someone bad.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Explicit memories-</h4>
    <p>
      Intentional or conscious recollection of info when trying to deliberately
      remember something. Remembering information during a test would be an
      explicit memory.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Procedural memories-</h4>
    <p>
      Memory for skills and habits. Most procedural memories are implicit
      because you don’t have to think about how to do it after learning.
      Walking, riding a bike, driving are examples.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Declarative memory-</h4>
    <p>
      Memory for factual info like names, faces, dates, etc. They are usually
      explicit memories that require conscious mental effort. Recalling the
      directions to drive somewhere is an example. They are declarative because
      you can declare you have the memory.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>There are two types of declarative memory.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Semantic memory-</h4>
    <p>
      Memory for things with meaning like language, facts, general knowledge and
      concepts. This is a lot of the info learned in school.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Episodic memory-</h4>
    <p>
      Memory of biographical details of our lives. It stores temporal coding
      like time tags to indicate when and context coding to indicate where.
