      <h2>Lesson 5.6 Thinking</h2>
      <h4>Thinking/Cognition-</h4>
      <p>
        Refers to a process that involves knowing, understanding, remembering,
        and communicating.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Concept-</h4>
      <p>
        A mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people. All
        chairs share the common features of a seat, back, and legs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We form some concepts by definitions but most of them are formed by
        mental images or an example, a prototype. When hearing robin, you think
        of a bird, but you don’t think of an ostrich, which is why a robin is a
        prototype of a bird. The definition of a triangle is a shape with 3
        sides.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Prototype-</h4>
      <p>
        A mental image or best example of a concept. We have a prototype for
        everything, such as for men, women, dogs, and cats.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Schema-</h4>
      <p>
        List of features or characteristics of a concept. A bird can fly, has a
        beak, feathers, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Helps us understand concepts and generate expectations about what the
        concept does. We expect cops to wear uniforms and help those in need.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Algorithm-</h4>
      <p>
        Methodical, logical rule, or procedure that guarantees solving a
        problem. Exhausts all possibilities before arriving at a solution,
        taking a long time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Heuristic-</h4>
      <p>
        Simple thinking strategy that allows for judgements and efficient
        problem solving. Success is not assured, but it is speedier than an
        algorithm. They can also bias judgement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Insight-</h4>
      <p>
        A sudden novel realization to the solution of a problem. Prior
        experience and trial-and-error are often needed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Brain imaging and EEGs suggest that when insight strikes, it activates
        the right temporal cortex, finding the solution in 0.3 seconds.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fixation-</h4>
      <p>
        The inability to see a problem from a fresh perspective or the
        impediment to problem solving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Mental set-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency for old patterns of problem solving to persist, making it
        impossible to see new ways to solve the problem. Seeing a set of double
        doors leads you to think that they are supposed to automatically open,
        and you forget that they could be push/pull.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Functional fixedness-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to think of only familiar functions for objects. Most
        people, when asked about the functions of a fork would only say for
        eating.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Confirmation bias-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to search for information that supports a personal bias, we
        look for evidence to support our ideas and dismiss evidence that denies
        our own way of thinking.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Representativeness heuristic-</h4>
      <p>
        Judging the likelihood of things or objects ibn terms of how well they
        seem to represent or matcha prototype. It allows for quick judgements. A
        short, soft spoken, glasses wearing man dressed in slacks would be
        identified as a librarian by the average person, not a construction
        worker.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Availability heuristic-</h4>
      <p>
        A cognitive shortcut where the probability of an event is determined by
        how easily it can be brought to mind. We choose the most mentally
        available alternative. People are more afraid of dying on a plane
        compared to a car because plane crashes receive much more publicity, and
        are more readily available in our minds, influencing our travel
        decisions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Overconfidence-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to overestimate the accuracy of one’s beliefs and
        judgements. While it poses some problems for making decisions, it is
        associated with happiness and making hard decisions easier since
        thinking that everything will work out can prevent worrying.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Exaggerated fear-</h4>
      <p>
        Opposed to overconfidence, the ill-founded fears about how things may
        happen. 9/11 led to a decline in air travel due to fear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Framing decisions-</h4>
      <p>
        How an issue is presented can affect decisions and judgement. The more
        positive something is made, the more people will respond to it. Surgery
        being reported as having 90% success sounds much better than having a
        10% failure.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Belief bias-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency for preexisting beliefs to distort logical reasoning by
        making invalid conclusions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Belief perseverance-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to cling to beliefs in the face of contrary evidence.
        Believing grass is purple even when scientific data is shown that it is
        green.
