      <h2>Lesson 5.4 Retrieval</h2>
      <p>Retrieval is getting info out of our memory storage.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Retrieval cues-</h4>
      <p>
        Stimuli that help people get info from long term memory, such as the
        term Coca-Cola creating images in the mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Memories are held in storage by a web of associations. These
        associations are like anchors that help to retrieve memories. Retrieval
        will depend on the type of memory and how well it is encoded/stored.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Recognition-</h4>
      <p>
        A person has to identify an item amongst other items, such as in a
        multiple-choice test.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Recall-</h4>
      <p>
        A person must retrieve information using effort, such as a fill in the
        blank test.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Relearning-</h4>
      <p>
        A person shows how much time and effort is saved when learning something
        a second time, like memorizing a list much faster the second time along.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Priming-</h4>
      <p>
        A procedure of providing cues that stimulate memories without awareness
        of the connection between the cue and the retrieved memory. Also
        referred to as memoryless memory because it is done without conscious
        awareness but predisposes us to recall info in a certain way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Context effects (state dependent memory)-</h4>
      <p>
        People will recall information better if they recall it in the same
        environment they learned it in. You will recall a question easier during
        a test if you studied in a similar environment, such as on a desk.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The more closely the retrieval cues match the form in which the info was
        encoded, the better the info will be remembered.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Déjà vu-</h4>
      <p>
        Cues from the current situation may unconsciously trigger the retrieval
        of an earlier similar experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Mood-congruent memory-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to recall experiences that are consistent with one’s
        current mood. Being in a happy mood will result in recalling happier
        moods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Tip of the tongue phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        The inability to recall a word or idea, while knowing it in your memory.
        The most comment instances of this are with names and familiar objects.
        It is a retrieval failure that happens due to interference during
        recall, a poor match between retrieval cues and encoding of information.
