      <h2>Lesson 5.2 Encoding</h2>
      <p>
        We have mental representations in our brain of images that the cognitive
        system understands.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Encoding-</h4>
      <p>
        Some information, such as the route to home, is automatically processed.
        Novel information, like a new person’s name, requires attention and
        effort to process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Automatic processing-</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of info is processed effortlessly like space, time, and frequency.
        We don’t have to rehearse this info to get it to our long-term memory.
        When reading a textbook, the place of a picture on the page is
        automatically encoded. When events happen in a day, they are
        unintentionally noted. We keep track unconsciously of how often things
        happen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Effortful processing-</h4>
      <p>
        Novel info requires effort, like learning a concept from a text.
        Processing leads to durable and accessible memories; practice makes
        perfect is very true when it comes to memory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Next in line effect-</h4>
      <p>
        Recall is better for what other people say but poor for a person just
        before you in line. You don’t pay attention to the person before, the
        info isn’t even getting to the brain, thus it is an encoding failure.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Spacing effect-</h4>
      <p>
        We retain info better when rehearsal is distributed over time. Studying
        a bit every night is better compared to cramming the night before a
        test.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Serial position (primacy recency) effect-</h4>
      <p>
        When recall is better for the first and last items, but poor for
        everything in between.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Visual encoding-</h4>
      <p>
        Mental imagery is a powerful aid to effortful processing, especially
        when combined with semantic encoding. Showing pictures of the side
        effects of smoking would be more powerful than just talking about it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Acoustic encoding-</h4>
      <p>The encoding of sounds.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Active processing-</h4>
      <p>
        Actively visualizing the target to remember and putting it in memory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Passive processing-</h4>
      <p>
        Just trying to memorize something without real processing for a short
        period.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Method of Loci (location)-</h4>
      <p>
        Involves moving through a familiar series of locations with items to be
        remembered.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Peg-word-</h4>
      <p>
        Memorizing a jingle and associating it with a list trying to remember.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Link method-</h4>
      <p>
        Forms a mental image of items to be remembered in a way that links them
        together.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Chunking-</h4>
      <p>
        Organizing items into familiar, manageable units, such as with acronyms.
      </p>
