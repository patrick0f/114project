      <h2>Lesson 5.9 Intelligence Testing</h2>
      <h4>Intelligence testing-</h4>
      <p>
        A method for assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing
        them with others using numerical scores.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Alfred Binet-</h4>
      <p>
        Binet and his colleague Theodore Simon developed the first standardized
        intelligence test while commissioned by the French government to create
        a test for children with problems in class.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Binet didn’t create the test to label children, he wanted to find a way
        to improve the educational experience of children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Mental age-</h4>
      <p>
        The average age of people who achieve a level of performance. A
        4-year-old child with the mental age of 6 would be academically
        advanced.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Lewis Terman-</h4>
      <p>
        In the US, he revised Binet’s test and named it the Stanford-Binet IQ
        test. Today, the Stanford-Binet is given orally and varies according to
        the tested. Children are given figures to copy or everyday problems to
        solve. Adults are asked to solve analogies, explain proverbs, and
        describe similarities in a set of words.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The exam starts by finding a mental age where all questions can be
        answered, moving to more difficult questions. The test ends when a
        mental age is reached where no questions can be answered.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>William Stern-</h4>
      <p>Created the intelligence quotient, or IQ, formula.</p>
      <p>IQ= (mental age/actual age) x100</p>
      <br />
      <h4>David Wechsler-</h4>
      <p>
        Developed the Wechsler adult intelligence scale, or WAIS, and the
        Wechsler intelligence scale for children, or WISC, an intelligence test
        for preschoolers. These are the most widely used IQ tests today.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>WAIS-</h4>
      <p>
        measures overall intelligence consisting of 2 parts, verbal and
        performance. Verbal includes vocabulary definitions and comprehension.
        Performance includes the timed assembly of small objects and arranged
        pictures in a logical order.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Achievement tests-</h4>
      <p>
        Reflect what you have already learned, your current level of knowledge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Aptitude tests-</h4>
      <p>
        Predict your ability to learn new skills, how well you could do on
        something.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Principles of test construction-</h4>
      <p>
        For a test to be acceptable it must be standardized, reliable, and
        valid.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Standardization-</h4>
      <p>
        Test items piloted on a similar population and norms have been
        established. Norms are developed by calculating the average score
        achieved by a particular group and then each person’s score can be
        compared to see how it differs from people who took it before. Tests are
        periodically re-standardized and given to a random representative
        population sample to check the new norms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Standardized tests establish a normal distribution of scores on a
        population, a bell-shaped pattern called the normal curve.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Flynn Effect-</h4>
      <p>The past 60 years have seen a rise in intelligence by 27 points.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reliability-</h4>
      <p>A test that yields consistent results is reliable.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Split half reliability-</h4>
      <p>
        Dividing the test into two equal halves and assessing how consistent the
        scores are
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Using different tests-</h4>
      <p>Using different tests to measure the consistency between them</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Test-retest reliability-</h4>
      <p>Using the same test on two occasions to measure consistency.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Validity-</h4>
      <p>
        Reliability does not ensure validity; a test can be consistent without
        testing what it is supposed to test. Validity refers to what the test is
        supposed to measure or predict.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Content validity-</h4>
      <p>Refers to the extent a test measures a behavior/trait.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Predictive validity-</h4>
      <p>Refers to the function of a test in predicting a behavior/trait.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fluid intelligence-</h4>
      <p>
        Reflects info-processing, reasoning, and memory skills. Declines as we
        age.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Crystallized intelligence-</h4>
      <p>Accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience. Increases with age.</p>
