      <h2>Lesson 5.1 Introduction to Memory</h2>
      <h4>Memory-</h4>
      <p>
        Any indication that learning has occurred over time. The ability to
        store and retrieve information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Spread of activation-</h4>
      <p>One idea leads to another.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Semantic memory-</h4>
      <p>Having similar memories with each other.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Episodic memories-</h4>
      <p>Memories unique to each person.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Flashbulb memory-</h4>
      <p>
        A unique and very emotional moment can create a strong and persistent
        memory that is subject to error.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stages of memory-</h4>
      <p>
        Stages are encoding, storage, and retrieval in a sequential process.
        Your senses, like the eyes, process information towards areas like
        Wernicke’s and Broca’s area so that the brain can understand the
        information. Then you store the information in your brain. Retrieval is
        when active thinking occurs and an attempt to retrieve the information.
        All 3 of these processes must occur to remember and learn.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Information processing-</h4>
      <p>
        Atkinson Schiffrin created a three-stage model of memory that includes
        sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sensory memory-</h4>
      <p>
        The initial momentary storage of info that lasts only for a second or
        two. Using our senses, it allows us to take in all information and
        determine if it is important enough to pay attention to. If it isn’t
        worth it, it is lost, decayed, or displaced.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Short term memory-</h4>
      <p>
        Memory that holds meaningful info for a short period, usually less than
        30 seconds. It is meaningful because the sensory memory determined that
        it was important enough to pay attention to. It has a limited capacity
        of 7+/- 2 items. It can store more info if the info is grouped together.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Information will leave the short-term memory if it isn’t rehearsed or
        repeated. Repetition will keep the info in the short-term memory and is
        necessary for it to be transferred into long term memory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Long term memory-</h4>
      <p>
        Memory that stores info on a relatively permanent basis. It appears to
        have a limitless capacity and info on long term memory is filed and
        coded so it can be retrieved when needed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some information skips the first two stages and enters long term memory
        immediately.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Selective attention-</h4>
      <p>
        Since we cannot focus on all the sensory info in the environment, we
        select info using attention.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Working memory-</h4>
      <p>
        Proposes that working memory acts as a workspace where info is retrieved
        and manipulated through rehearsal, instead of the simpler version of
        short-term memory. It is a central executive that contains auditory and
        visual processing that makes decisions and reasons. It allows us to
        briefly maintain info in an active state so we can do something with it.
        You have to work with the information before putting it into long-term
        memory, it can’t just sit somewhere like it would in short term memory.
