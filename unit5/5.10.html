      <h2>Lesson 5.10 Language</h2>
      <h4>Language-</h4>
      <p>
        Our spoken, written, or gestured word; the way we communicate meaning to
        ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Phonemes-</h4>
      <p>
        The smallest distinctive sound unit in a spoken language. Bat has three
        phonemes, b,a,t. There are about 40 phonemes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Morpheme-</h4>
      <p>
        The smallest unit that carries meaning that may be a word or part of a
        word. Unforgettable has 4 morphemes, un,for,get,table. There are 100,000
        morphemes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Words-</h4>
      <p>Meaningful units. There are about 290,500 words.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Phrase-</h4>
      <p>Composed of two or more words. There are about 326,000 phrases.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sentence-</h4>
      <p>Composed of many words. There are an infinite number of sentences.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Grammar-</h4>
      <p>
        The system of rules in a language that enables communication and
        understanding. It is composed of semantics and syntax.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Semantics-</h4>
      <p>
        A set of rules through which meaning is derived from morphemes, words,
        and sentences. Semantic rules say that adding -ed (a morpheme) to the
        end of a word means it occurred in the past.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Syntax-</h4>
      <p>
        The rules for combining words into grammatically sensible sentences.
        Syntactical rule is that adjectives come before nouns, like white house
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Language development-</h4>
      <p>
        Children learn their native language much before learning 2+2. After age
        1, we learn 3,500 words a year, meaning we know 60,000 words by the time
        high school is over.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Babbling stage-</h4>
      <p>
        Beginning at 4 months, the infant spontaneously utters various sounds
        like goo-goo-ga-ga. Babbling isn’t an imitation of adult speech. Until
        babies are 9-10 months old, they can’t differentiate the native language
        of their household.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>One-word stage-</h4>
      <p>
        On the first birthday or so, a child begins speaking one-word pieces to
        communicate. These words usually are short and begin with consonants
        (letters that aren’t vowels) like b, d , m, p, or t. Children can
        understand a lot of the language they hear at and before this stage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Two-word stage-</h4>
      <p>
        Before their second year, children start speaking in two-word sentences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Telegraphic speech-</h4>
      <p>
        The form of speech in which children speak is like a telegram, using
        mainly nouns and verbs. “Go car” means “I want to go in the car.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Longer phrases-</h4>
      <p>
        After telegraphic speech children will start uttering longer phrases,
        like “go to store”, with syntactical sense, and they start understanding
        humor by early elementary school.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Skinner-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed that we learn to talk through operant conditioning. He thought
        that language development is not inherently born with us, it can be
        explained on the basis of learning principles such as association,
        imitation, and reinforcement. Children learn to speak because they are
        rewarded for making sounds close to adult speech, they are shaped until
        they form correct words, such as with praise and reinforcement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Chomsky-</h4>
      <p>
        Opposed Skinner’s ideas and suggested that the rate of language
        acquisition is so fast that it can’t be explained by learning. As a
        result, language is inborn. He supports his claim with the idea that
        languages have a universal grammar, a similar underlying structure of
        all languages. He believes in the presence of a language acquisition
        device that is switched on through exposure to language in the
        environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Statistical learning-</h4>
      <p>
        Before age 1, our brains analyze which syllables in words go together in
        words. This analysis is learned during critical periods of child
        development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Benjamin Whorf-</h4>
      <p>
        Created the idea of linguistic determinism, language determines the way
        we think and perceive the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Thinking in language-</h4>
      <p>
        When a language provides words for objects or events, we can think about
        them more clearly and retain them. It is easier to think about two
        colors with two different names than two colors with the same name.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To a large extent thinking is language based, but we also think in
        images. We don’t think in words when riding a bicycle, for example.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When we imagine doing a physical activity, the same corresponding brain
        regions activate as when we actually perform that activity. Most
        psychologists believe thoughts influence language and vice versa.

      <h3 class="vocab">Other Important Vocabulary</h3>
      <h4>Iconic memory-</h4>
      <p>A momentary sensory memory of visual stimuli.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Long term potentiation-</h4>
      <p>
        An increase in a synapse’s firing potential after a brief rapid
        stimulation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Rosy retrospection-</h4>
      <p>
        The phenomenon of judging the past more positively than the present.
        Looking back at the past and thinking of it as much better even when it
        might not have been.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Echoic memory-</h4>
      <p>A momentary sensory memory of auditory stimuli.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reconstruction memory-</h4>
      <p>
        The process of assembling info from stored memory when a clear memory
        doesn’t exist. An interviewer works with a crime victim to create a
        memory of the events surrounding a crime.
      </p>
      <br />

        they are part of it or not. Things that are directly related to someone
        will be encoded better.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Nomenclature-</h4>
      <p>
        The choosing of names for things. Deciding to call a banana a banana.
