      <h2>Lesson 3.1 Basics of Sensation and Perception</h2>
      <h4>Sensation-</h4>
      <p>
        Detecting physical stimulus from the environment and converting it to
        neural signals
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perception-</h4>
      <p>Selecting, organizing, and interpreting sensations</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bottom-up processing-</h4>
      <p>
        The analysis of the stimulus begins with sense receptors and working up
        to the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Top-down processing-</h4>
      <p>
        Information processing guided by higher level mental processes using
        experience and expectations
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Absolute threshold-</h4>
      <p>The minimum stimulation needed to detect a stimulus 50% of the time</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Difference threshold—</h4>
      <p>
        The minimum difference between two existing stimuli required for
        detection 50% of the time, just noticeable difference
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Weber’s law-</h4>
      <p>
        The size of the difference threshold is proportional to the intensity of
        the stimulus. If the intensity is high, then the difference needed will
        be large and vice versa.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Subliminal threshold-</h4>
      <p>
        When stimuli are below the absolute threshold for awareness. Most will
        not detect it, but some will since it still exists. Subliminal words can
        prime a person’s responses but not impact a group’s habits.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Signal detection theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Predicts how and when we detect the presence of a faint stimuli amid
        background noise. Assumes detection is based on experience,
        expectations, motivation, and fatigue. Like hearing a voice in the
        middle of a crowd.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sensory adaptation-</h4>
      <p>Diminished sensitivity as a result of constant stimulation</p>
