      <h2>Lesson 3.2 Vision</h2>
      <h4>Parts of the eye-</h4>
      <p>Cornea is the outside covering of the eye.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The pupil is a hole in the eye that allows light to enter.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The iris is the colored ring that controls how much light enters.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Lens focuses light onto the retina and flips the image upside down to
        project for the retina
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Retina is where transduction occurs, where the organ translates stimulus
        into a neural message.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Fovea is where most of the cones are and the point of focus.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Blind spot is where the optic nerve leaves the eye</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hue-</h4>
      <p>
        Allows for color, the dimension of color determined by wavelength of
        light.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Wavelength-</h4>
      <p>
        The distance from the peak of one wave to the peak of the next. Short
        wavelengths have a higher frequency with blue colors and high-pitched
        sounds. Long wavelengths have red colors and lower pitches.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intensity/brightness-</h4>
      <p>
        The amount of energy in a wave is determined by amplitude, which is
        related to perceived brightness. High amplitudes mean bright and loud,
        small amplitude means dull and soft. As intensity changes, colors will
        vary from dark to light.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Nearsightedness-</h4>
      <p>
        A condition where nearby objects are more closely seen because the eye
        is elongated, and the image focuses before it hits the retina.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Farsightedness-</h4>
      <p>
        A condition where far objects are more closely seen because the eye is
        shortened, and images focus after hitting the retina.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Retina-</h4>
      <p>
        The light sensitive inner surface of the eye that contains rods and
        cones, and other neurons including bipolar and ganglion cells, that
        processes visual info. Images hit the back of the retina where the cones
        and rods are, working their way forward to bipolar and ganglion cells.
        Cones allow for color to be perceived while rods allow for vision in the
        dark since they are light sensitive. The axons of the ganglion cells
        send the information out, creating the optic nerve.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fovea-</h4>
      <p>
        The central point of the retina where all the cones are clustered. Since
        most cones are clustered here, periphery vision has little color. Rods
        make up peripheral vision since they are on the periphery of the retina.
        Cones donâ€™t exist on the furthest periphery. The pupil dilates to allow
        for more light to be exposed and for more rods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Rods vs Cones-</h4>
      <p>
        There are 6 million cones mainly in the fovea. They are color sensitive
        with low sensitivity in dim light and are good at detecting details.
        Each cone has its own bipolar cell, allowing for more detailed and
        focused images.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are 120 million rods in the periphery of the eye. They are not
        color sensitive but have high sensitivity in low light and are bad at
        detecting detail. Every 4 rods share a bipolar cell, creating distorted
        and less detailed images.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bipolar cells-</h4>
      <p>
        Receive messages from photoreceptors and transmit them to ganglion
        cells.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Blind spot-</h4>
      <p>Where no visual receptors are because of the info leaving the eye.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Feature detection-</h4>
      <p>
        Nerve cells in the visual cortex that respond to features like edges,
        angle, length, and movement. There are some detectors that work best on
        the human face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Visual information processing-</h4>
      <p>
        The processing of several aspects of the stimulus simultaneously, also
        known as parallel processing. The brain divides it into subdivisions
        like color, depth, form, and movement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Visual process-</h4>
      <p>
        A scene is displayed, and retinal processing occurs (rods and cones to
        bipolar cells to ganglion cells). The information is sent to the
        thalamus where it is then sent to the visual cortex. Feature detection
        responds to the stimuli and detects for features. The information goes
        to associated areas where abstraction (higher level cells respond to
        information from feature detection cells) occurs. Then the info goes to
        the memory where the brain matches the image with stored images in the
        memory.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Trichromatic theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Also known as the young Helmholtz theory, suggests that the retina is
        sensitive to red, green, and blue colors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Color deficiency/blindness-</h4>
      <p>
        A genetic disorder that prevents people from discriminating between
        colors due to a deficient cone. Red/green blindness is the most common.
        Complete color deficiency is rare, but it does exist.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Opponent process theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Hering proposed that we process 4 primary colors opposed in red-green,
        blue-yellow, and black-white.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Color constancy-</h4>
      <p>
        The color of an object will remain consistent regardless of lighting and
        wavelength.
