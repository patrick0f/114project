      <h2>Lesson 3.5 Perception</h2>
      <p>
        Everything after transduction (the processing of external stimuli by the
        senses into brain waves) is perception, the brainâ€™s interpretation and
        organization of information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Visual capture-</h4>
      <p>When vision competes with other senses and wins</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gestalt psychology-</h4>
      <p>The whole is different from the sum of its parts.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Figure ground-</h4>
      <p>
        The organization of the visual field into objects and their background.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gestalt grouping-</h4>
      <p>
        Our perception organizes figures into forms using grouping rules such as
        proximity, similarity, continuity, and connectedness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Closure-</h4>
      <p>When our brain fills in the holes in the information perceived.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Depth perception-</h4>
      <p>Allows for the judgement of distances.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Monocular cues-</h4>
      <p>Cues that allow for depth judgment and require one eye.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Interposition-</h4>
      <p>Objects that block other objects tend to be perceived as closer.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Linear perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Parallel lines like road lines appear to come together as they are
        further away. The more they come together, the further away they are
        perceived.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Relative size-</h4>
      <p>
        When two images are similar in size, the one that has a smaller retinal
        image is further away.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Relative height-</h4>
      <p>Objects that have a higher height are perceived as further away.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Texture gradient-</h4>
      <p>Indistinct or finer textures show increasing distance</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Binocular cues-</h4>
      <p>Cues that require both eyes to properly use depth perception.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Convergence-</h4>
      <p>
        The eyes move inwards closer to the nose to see closer objects and
        further away to see further objects. Objects are perceived as closer the
        more the eyes are closer together.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Retinal disparity-</h4>
      <p>
        When the images from both eyes differ. The greater the difference, the
        closer the object.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stroboscopic motion-</h4>
      <p>
        The tendency to perceive motion in a series of slightly varied still
        images in rapid succession, like a flipbook.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Phi phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        When lights flash at certain speed they present illusions of movement.
        Signs use this to create motion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perceptual constancy-</h4>
      <p>
        Perceiving objects as unchanging despite illumination and retinal image
        changes. Includes constancies of shape and size.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Size constancy-</h4>
      <p>
        Seeing objects as the same size despite the changing size of the
        stimuli.
