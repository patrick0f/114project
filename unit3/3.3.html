      <h2>Lesson 3.3 Hearing</h2>
      <p>
        Sound is a vibration of air. Frequency or pitch is measured in hertz or
        Hz. Humans can hear sounds ranging from 20 hz-20,000 hz. Optimal sounds
        are around 3-4,000 hz since that is where human speech is.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intensity-</h4>
      <p>
        Also known as loudness, the amount of energy in a wave relates to the
        perceived loudness of it measured in decibels. Prolonged exposure to 85
        decibels or above will cause hearing loss. Anything above 0 will be the
        absolute threshold.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Pinna-</h4>
      <p>The outside of the ear where sound is collected and funneled.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Auditory canal-</h4>
      <p>Where sound travels to reach the middle ear</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Eardrum-</h4>
      <p>The tympanic membrane that vibrates</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bones of the middle ear-</h4>
      <p>Includes the hammer, stirrup, and anvil.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Semicircular canals-</h4>
      <p>Controls vestibular sense</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Oval window-</h4>
      <p>Where the stirrup attaches to the cochlea and the inner ear begins</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cochlea-</h4>
      <p>
        Where the hair cells and follicles of the ear are. A coiled, bony, fluid
        filled tube that transduces sound.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Frequency theory-</h4>
      <p>
        The rate of nerve impulses traveling the auditory nerve matches the
        frequency of a tone, allowing for the sensing of the pitch.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Place theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Sound frequencies stimulate basilar membrane at specific places
        resulting in pitch perception.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Localization-</h4>
      <p>
        Sounds that reach one ear faster than the other creates localization
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hearing loss-</h4>
      <p>
        The older we get, we tend to lose the ability to detect high frequency
        sounds. Damage to hair cells over time is noise induced hearing loss.
        Any sound loud enough to produce tinnitus, ringing of the ears, causes
        damage. Small amounts of this damage accumulate over time. High
        intensity sounds can tear off hair cells in the inner ear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conduction deafness-</h4>
      <p>
        Hearing loss caused by damage to the mechanical system (middle ear) that
        conducts waves to the cochlea. Can be fixed with surgery or hearing
        aids.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sensorineural deafness-</h4>
      <p>
        Hearing loss caused by damage to the cochlea’s receptor cells or the
        auditory nerve, a permanent condition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cochlear implant-</h4>
      <p>
        A small electronic device that helps to provide a sense of sound to a
        deaf person. There is an external potion behind the ear and an internal
        portion under the skin. It is made up of a microphone that picks up
        sound from the environment, a speech processor that selects and arranges
        sound from the microphone, a transmitter and receiver that receives
        signals from the processor and converts it to electrical impulses, and
        an electrode array that collects the impulse from the stimulator and
        sends it to regions of the auditory nerve.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Implants don’t restore hearing but help deaf people to understand
        speech.
