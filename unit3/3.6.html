      <h2>Lesson 3.6 Interpretation</h2>
      <h4>Restored vision-</h4>
      <p>
        After cataract surgery blind adults were able to see. They could
        differentiate figure and ground but could tell the difference between a
        circle and triangle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Facial recognition-</h4>
      <p>
        Blind people, after regaining sight were unable to recognize faces, only
        distinct features. Normal people have a hard time when the lower half of
        a picture is changed in facial recognition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sensory deprivation-</h4>
      <p>
        Kittens raised without exposure to horizontal lines had later difficulty
        in perceiving horizontal bars. Suggests vision is a partly acquired
        sense. Sensations are impacted by a lack of stimulation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perceptual adaptation-</h4>
      <p>The visual ability to adjust to an artificially displaced field.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perceptual set-</h4>
      <p>A mental predisposition to perceive one thing and not another.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Schema-</h4>
      <p>
        Concepts that organize and interpret unfamiliar information. Develop
        through experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Context effects-</h4>
      <p>
        A given stimulus can evoke different perceptions based on the context of
        the stimulus
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cultural context-</h4>
      <p>Context from culture can influence perception</p>
      <br />
      <p>Perception has biopsychosocial influences.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Biological influences include entry level sensory analysis, unlearned
        visual phenomena, critical period for sensory development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychological influences included selective attention, learned schemas,
        gestalt principles, emotional context effects, and perceptual sets.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Socio-cultural influences include cultural assumptions and expectations
        and physical context effects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Human factors-</h4>
      <p>
        Understanding human factors can help to design equipment that avoids
        disaster. Many accidents are based on errors of perception.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Extrasensory perception (ESP)-</h4>
      <p>
        Perception without sensory input. A large percentage of scientists don’t
        believe in ESP.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Paranormal phenomena include astrological predictions, healing,
        communication with the dead, out of body experiences, etc. The most
        relevant are telepathy, clairvoyance, and precognition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Telepathy-</h4>
      <p>
        Mind to mind communication, one person sending thoughts and another
        receiving them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Clairvoyance-</h4>
      <p>Perception of remote present events.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Precognition-</h4>
      <p>Perceiving future events.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Psychokinesis-</h4>
      <p>Performing a physical task with your mind, like telekinesis.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        People continue to believe in ESP because they want to or because they
        know someone who thinks they have experienced ESP.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Scientists cannot validate ESP because they cannot replicate the
        instances of the abilities in labs.

      <h4>Accommodation-</h4>
      <p>
        The process of the eye’s lens changing shape to focus on objects near or
        far
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Selective attention-</h4>
      <p>The focusing of conscious awareness on a stimulus</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Change blindness-</h4>
      <p>Failing to notice changes in the environment</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Inattentional blindness-</h4>
      <p>
        Failing to see visible objects when concentration is directed elsewhere
      </p>

      <h4>Visual cliff-</h4>
      <p>
        A lab device for testing depth perception in infants and young animals
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hypnagogic sensation-</h4>
      <p>An imagined sensation that feels real.</p>
