      <h2>Lesson 3.4 Touch and Taste</h2>
      <h4>Somatic senses-</h4>
      <p>Sense of touch is a mix of pressure, warmth, cold, and pain.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Only pressure has receptors. All other skin sensations are variations of
        pressures, warmth, cold, and pain
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Pain-</h4>
      <p>
        Tells the body that something has gone wrong. Pain usually results from
        damage to the skin or other tissues. A rare disease where pain isn’t
        felt is called congenital insensitivity to pain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Pain has biopsychosocial influences.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Activity in the spinal cord’s fibers, genetic differences in endorphin
        production, and the brain’s interpretation of CNS activity make up
        biological influences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Attention to pain, learning with pain, and expectations of pain relief
        are psychological influences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The presence of others, empathy for others, and cultural expectations
        are socio-cultural influences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gate control theory-</h4>
      <p>
        A theory that says our spinal cords contain gates that either block pain
        or allow it to be sensed. Substance P is the neurotransmitter that tells
        the gate to open and send messages of pain to the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pain is first transmitted to the thalamus where it is relayed to the
        somatosensory cortex and the limbic system. The sensory cortex senses
        the components of pain, judges the quality, location, and intensity. The
        limbic system creates emotional and motivational components of pain,
        unpleasantness, and the desire to escape (fight or flight). Lastly, the
        information is sent to the prefrontal cortex where the secondary
        emotional and motivational components of brain are as well as suffering
        and worry about the future.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Pain control-</h4>
      <p>
        Pain can be controlled by therapy including drugs, surgery, acupuncture,
        exercise, hypnosis, and thought distraction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Phantom limb pain-</h4>
      <p>
        Pain is not from just stimulation. It occurs when people missing a limb
        feel painful sensations originating from the missing part. It could be
        due to cross wiring in the sensory cortex where nearby areas take over
        for the missing limb so stimulation there causes sensation in the
        missing limb.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Taste/gustation-</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Taste buds regenerate every 2 weeks. A high concentration of taste buds
        means a more sensitive gustation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Tastes include sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami, and astringent.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Smell/olfaction-</h4>
      <p>
        Both smell and taste are chemical tastes because the stimuli the
        receptors receive are chemicals that enter the body.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For smell, odorants enter the nasal cavity to stimulate 5 million
        receptors or smell. Humans can detect 10,000 smells. Olfactory receptors
        regenerate once a month. Smells go through the nasal cavity and
        stimulate the olfactory bulb in the brain instead of straight to the
        thalamus like other senses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The brain region for smell is closely connected with the limbic system
        that is involved in memory, which is why smell is so crucial in
        memories.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sensory interaction-</h4>
      <p>When one sense affects another.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Kinesthesis-</h4>
      <p>The sense of our individual body parts and movement</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Vestibular sense-</h4>
      <p>
        The monitoring of the body’s head and position located in the
        semicircular canal ear.
