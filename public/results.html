          <p>Your overall diet assessment is: 6/10 </p>
          <p>Your diet is moderately balanced but low in fermented foods and a bit short on daily servings of fruits and vegetables. You also enjoy sugary snacks a few times a week, which could be trimmed back. <br>
          </p>
          <p> To supplement your fermented-food deficiency, consider kimchi! This vibrant, tangy Korean staple is bursting with live probiotics that nourish your gut microbiome, boost digestion, and deliver a punch of vitamins A and C—all in one delicious, crunchy bite!

        <p>General Tips:</p>
      <p>The average person should be consuming at least 25-30 grams of fiber a day! Studies show that eating whole grains and legumes can help support weight management and gut health, (Slavin).
        </p>
        <p>You should be eating no more than 10% of your daily calories from saturated fats, as advised by the Dietary Guidelines (USDA). This includes meat, butter, and dairy!</p>
