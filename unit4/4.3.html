      <h2>Lesson 4.3 Operant Conditioning</h2>
      <h4>Operant and classical conditioning-</h4>
      <p>
        Classical conditioning forms associations between stimuli like the
        conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Operant conditioning forms associations between behaviors and resulting
        events.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Law of Effect-</h4>
      <p>
        EL Thorndike said that responses that produce desirable results will be
        learned by an organism. He found cats would solve puzzles quicker in
        trial-and-error to obtain a food reward. Erroneous responses were
        eliminated over time, leading to strengthened purely effective and
        efficient responses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Operant chamber-</h4>
      <p>
        BF Skinner used the law of effect to develop the operant chamber or
        Skinner box. It came with a bar or key that an animal had to manipulate
        to obtain a food or water reinforcer, connected to devices that record
        the animal’s responses. Skinner taught pigeons how to read and is most
        closely associated with operant conditioning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Shaping-</h4>
      <p>
        An operant conditioning procedure where reinforcers guide behavior
        closer to the target behavior using successive approximations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reinforcer-</h4>
      <p>
        Any event that strengthens the desired response every time it occurs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Types of reinforcers-</h4>
      <p>An event that strengthens the behavior it follows</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Positive reinforcement-</h4>
      <p>
        Adds a desirable stimulus, like getting a hug or receiving a paycheck.
        Ask what it will add, i.e., money.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Negative reinforcement-</h4>
      <p>
        Removes an aversive or bad stimulus, like fastening a seatbelt in order
        to remove an annoying alarm. The alarm is an aversive stimulus, and the
        behavior is increased in fastening the seatbelt.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Primary reinforcer-</h4>
      <p>
        An innately reinforcing stimulus that satisfies a biological need like
        food or drink.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conditioned/secondary reinforcer-</h4>
      <p>
        A learned reinforcer that obtains power through association with a
        primary reinforcer like grades, praise, or money.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Immediate reinforcer-</h4>
      <p>
        A reinforcer that occurs closely to a behavior in time, like getting
        food for sitting down.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Delayed reinforcer-</h4>
      <p>
        A reinforcer that is delayed for a certain behavior, like getting paid
        every week. WE are more inclined to engage in small immediate
        reinforcers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reinforcers-</h4>
      <p>
        Increases behavior. Ask yourself if the consequence will increase the
        behavior, if yes, then it is a reinforcer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Continuous reinforcement-</h4>
      <p>
        Reinforcing the desired response every time it occurs, used when initial
        learning is taking place. Best at helping a subject make the connection
        between a behavior and the consequence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Partial/intermittent reinforcement-</h4>
      <p>
        Reinforcing the desired response partly. Results in slower initial
        acquisition, but a strengthened behavior that’s resistant to extinction.
        Splits off into fixed-variable and ratio-interval.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fixed and variable-</h4>
      <p>
        Fixed means you know when it is happening; it is set and fixed. Variable
        means it is unknown when it occurs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fixed ratio schedule-</h4>
      <p>
        Reinforces a response after a certain number of responses, like buy 10
        get one free.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Variable ratio schedule-</h4>
      <p>
        Reinforces a response after an unspecified number of responses, like
        gambling. Produces more responses than other methods and is resistant to
        extinction due to unpredictability.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fixed interval-</h4>
      <p>
        Reinforces a response after a specific time has passed, like getting
        paid every 2 weeks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Variable interval-</h4>
      <p>
        Reinforces a response after an unspecified time has passed, like
        fishing. This produces slow and steady responding.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Punishment-</h4>
      <p>Decreases behavior due to an aversive event.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Positive punishment-</h4>
      <p>
        Gives or administers an aversive stimulus, like spanking or giving a
        parking ticket.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Negative punishment-</h4>
      <p>
        Also called omission training, withdraws a desirable stimulus, like
        revoking a driver’s license.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Effects-</h4>
      <p>
        Punishment usually leads to negative effects. It can result in unwanted
        fears, it conveys no information to the organism, it justifies pain to
        others, and unwanted behaviors can reappear in its absence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cognition in operant conditioning-</h4>
      <p>
        Edward Tolman found that rats seemed to develop cognitive maps of the
        layout in the maze because if the normal route was blocked, it would
        find an alternate path. The detour would be the shortest path around the
        barrier even though the rat hadn’t been reinforced for that path. Brain
        images showed the hippocampus responsible for drawing the map.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>These maps are based on latent learning.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biological predisposition-</h4>
      <p>
        Biological constraints predispose organisms to learn associations that
        are naturally adaptive and help them survive. Breland showed that
        animals naturally drift towards these instinctive behaviors, known as
        instinctual drift.
