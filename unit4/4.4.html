      <h2>Lesson 4.4 Observational Learning</h2>
      <h4>Observational learning-</h4>
      <p>
        Also known as vicarious learning. Higher animals learn through observing
        and imitating others. Monkeys and humans imitate each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bandura’s theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Observational learning occurs in 4 stages. Paying attention and
        perceiving features of behavior, remembering the behavior, reproducing
        it, and being motivated to learn and carry out the behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Bandura’s bobo doll study indicated that individuals learn through
        imitating others who receive reward and punishments. When children
        watched adults being rewarded for aggression, they too acted
        aggressively with the bobo doll, even taking it further and more
        violently.

      <h4>Applications-</h4>
      <p>
        Prosocial, or positive and helpful, models can have prosocial effects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Antisocial, such as family, neighborhood, or TV, models may have
        antisocial effects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Television-</h4>
      <p>
        From 5-15, the average child witnesses at least 13,000 deaths on TV. A
        study showed that elementary children who were exposed to violent TV,
        videos, and video games expressed increased aggression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Implications-</h4>
      <p>
        We are more likely to imitate those that are similar to us, those
        successful and admirable, behaviors that are reinforced rather than
        punished, and those whose actions are consistent.

      <h4>Extrinsic motivation-</h4>
      <p>
        A desire to perform a behavior to receive a reward or avoid a
        punishment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intrinsic motivation-</h4>
      <p>A desire to perform a behavior for its own sake.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Respondent behavior-</h4>
      <p>Behavior that occurs as an automatic response to a stimulus.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Higher order conditioning-</h4>
      <p>
        A procedure where a conditioned stimulus is paired with a new neutral
        stimulus to create a second weaker conditioned stimulus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Associative learning-</h4>
      <p>Learning that certain events occur together.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Learned helplessness-</h4>
      <p>
        Hopelessness and resignation learned when unable to avoid repeated
        aversive events.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>John Garcia-</h4>
      <p>
        Found that aversion to a taste is conditioned by pairing the taste,
        conditioned stimulus, with nausea, unconditioned stimulus. If the taste
        is paired with another unconditioned stimulus, conditioning won’t occur.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        His experiment used rats that would associate a taste, but not a light
        or a sound, with illness. He found that pain would also only be
        associated with a visual or auditory cue, not a taste.
