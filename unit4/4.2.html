      <h2>Lesson 4.2 More on Classical Conditioning</h2>
      <h4>JB Watson-</h4>
      <p>
        The main leader and founder of behaviorism. In 1913, he wrote the
        “behaviorist manifesto,” which consisted of three sentences:
        psychology’s content should be behavior, its method should be objective,
        not introspective, and its goal should be to predict and control
        behavior rather than to understand mental events. Behaviorists don’t
        believe in any cognitive or mental aspects of psychology, purely
        behavioral and physical.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Behaviorism’s popularity led to Watson being elected APA president in
        1915.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Watson had an affair with his research assistant Rosalie Rayner, forcing
        him to retire from research and psychology in 1930. He later moved on to
        work with an advertising company where he utilized his background to
        sell products. He shows that people’s preferences of products were based
        on their associations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        He developed many successful campaigns, such as using the idea of a
        coffee break, using testimonies from the queens of Romania and Spain,
        and convincing mothers to use baby powder after every diaper change.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        He was awarded the APA’s gold medal in 1958 for his contributions to
        psychology.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Little Albert-</h4>
      <p>
        Watson and Rayner classically conditioned an infant using a gong as a
        UCS to produce the UCR of fear and a mouse as a NS.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Albert eventually generalized his fear of the mouse to other hairy,
        small items like fur coats. He moved away before Watson was able to
        uncondition the fear, but he likely got rid of the fear eventually due
        to extinction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Counterconditioning-</h4>
      <p>
        Patients can be taught to respond in a relaxed manner to a conditioned
        stimulus until the conditioned response is eventually extinct.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Taste aversions-</h4>
      <p>
        People can avoid a food because of an unpleasant experience with it.
        This can occur after a significant delay, unlike normal classical
        conditioning.
      </p>
      <br />
          <p>Early behaviorists believed that behaviors of animals could be reduced to mindless mechanisms. Robert Rescorla agreed with this, but thought it was a limited idea. He created a contingency model that added cognition to classical conditioning.</p><br>
          <h4>Contingency model of classical conditioning-</h4>
          <p>A is contingent, or dependent, upon B, and vice versa. In other words, the conditioned stimulus or neutral stimulus, the tuning fork, must predict the unconditioned stimulus, the food, or there won’t be any response. He adds cognition into conditioning because the subject can identify a pattern. Learning occurs when the relationship between the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus is clear and predictable; the dog expects food when hearing the tuning fork and salivates.</p><br>
          <p>The phone has rung for 3 days, and every time, you are called to the office. The next day, the phone rings again, so you automatically start heading out for the office. A, the phone ringing, is contingent upon B, you being called to the office, because whenever A, the phone ringing, B, getting called to the office, occurs. You got up because you have cognition and are able to expect that you will be called.</p><br>
          <h4>Insight learning-</h4>
          <p>A form of cognitive learning where problem solving occurs through sudden reorganization of perception.</p><br>
          <p>Wolfgang Kohler discovered that chimps could solve complex problems by combining simpler behaviors that they had previously learnt. A chimp learnt to obtain bananas through piling boxes or using a stick. When the banana was hung up high, the chimp combined both experiences
              to get the banana.</p><br>
              <h4>Biological influences-</h4>
              <p>Animals and humans are biologically prepared to make certain connections. Associating strange tastes with sickness or avoiding a food has aided survival, so taste aversion seems to have been biologically programmed in humans and animals.</p><br>
              <h4>Latent learning-</h4>
              <p>Latent means hidden. It is learning that isn’t obvious until a reinforcement is given.</p><br>
              <p>Mice were placed in a closed maze and left to wander around. They were later taken out, the exits opened, and a piece of cheese as reinforcement was placed at the exit. The mice that had experience wandering had a much faster time reaching the cheese and completing the maze compared to other mice that hadn’t previously wandered.</p><br>
              <p>Here, learning is shown to have taken place despite a lack of reinforcement.</p><br>
