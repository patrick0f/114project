      <h2>Lesson 4.1 Classical Conditioning</h2>
      <h4>Conditioning-</h4>
      <p>
        A way to change behavior using unlearned stimuli and responses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Learning-</h4>
      <p>
        A relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience. No change
        means no learning. We learn through associations; our minds connect
        events that occur in sequence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stimulus to stimulus learning-</h4>
      <p>
        Learning to associate a stimulus with another stimulus, part of
        classical conditioning where the association is made. Lightning is seen,
        and thunder is heard in sequence, thus they are associated. As a result,
        we associate them and respond to lightning because we connect them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Classical conditioning-</h4>
      <p>
        A Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov exposed classical conditioning.
        Learning occurs when a neutral stimulus (one that doesn’t create a
        response) brings a response when paired with a stimulus that does create
        a response.

      <p>
        He observed that dogs would salivate when food was brought. He inferred
        that dogs associated food with salivation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Unconditioned-</h4>
      <p>Naturally existing or unlearned.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An unconditioned (untrained) stimulus leads to an unconditioned
        (natural) response.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conditioned-</h4>
      <p>Learned and trained.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In conditioning, a previously neutral or natural stimulus is transformed
        into a conditioned stimulus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Unconditioned responses and conditioned responses are typically similar
        or the same.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stimulus-</h4>
      <p>The thing that elicits a response.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Response-</h4>
      <p>The reaction or behavior in reaction to a stimulus.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Pavlov’s Experiment-</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pavlov was trying to understand the digestive process. When he observed
        classical conditioning, his actual research was going awry because the
        dogs would salivate before the food was in their mouths.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        His experiment consisted of food, the unconditioned stimulus/UCS,
        producing salivation, the unconditioned response/UCR. He paired the food
        with a tuning fork, the neutral stimulus that didn’t create a response.
        He did this multiple times to condition the dog. The initial
        conditioning required the neutral stimulus to occur a split second
        before the unconditioned stimulus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Food leads to salivation, tuning fork produces no response, the tuning
        fork and the food led to salvation. Conditioning is successful when the
        unconditioned stimulus, or the food, is no longer present but the dog
        still salivates when hearing the tuning fork, or conditioned stimulus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hot water leads to flinching, flushing produces no response, the
        flushing and hot water lead to flinching. Conditioning is successful
        when the hot water isn’t present, but the person still flinches when
        hearing the flushing.
