      <h2>Lesson 1.2 Critical Thinking</h2>

      <h4>Hindsight bias-</h4>
      <p>
        The “I knew it all phenomenon”. We believe after learning about an
        outcome that we would have foreseen it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Overconfidence-</h4>
      <p>People tend to know more than they think they do</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Pseudoscience-</h4>
      <p>Popular beliefs seemingly related to science</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Confirmation bias-</h4>
      <p>
        Looking for evidence to confirm beliefs while ignoring all other
        disproving evidence. Can be intentional or unintentional.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Scientific attitude-</h4>
      <p>An attitude composed of curiosity, skepticism, and humility.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Critical thinking-</h4>
      <p>
        Not blindly believing of arguments and conclusions. Examines
        assumptions, discerns values, evaluates evidence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Scientific method-</h4>
      <p>
        Psychologists use the scientific method to construct theories that
        interpret observations. It is systematic, so that things can be proven
        or disproven.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Theory-</h4>
      <p>
        An explanation that integrates principles, organizes and predicts
        behaviors. Is highly researched and has tested frameworks that organize
        studies under an umbrella.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hypothesis-</h4>
      <p>
        A testable prediction induced by theory that allows for revision or
        confirmation. Also a statement of relationship between variables. (If,
        then)
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Research observation-</h4>
      <p>
        The application of a hypothesis through systematic observation and
        manipulation of variables.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Operational definition-</h4>
      <p>
        A precise definition of a variable being observed so that it is
        measurable and manageable (doable). Allows for scientists to replicate
        similar studies to prove or disprove the theory.
