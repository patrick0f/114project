      <h2>Lesson 1.5 Experiments</h2>
      <h4>Experiments-</h4>
      <p>
        Experiments are the only research method to isolate cause and effect.
        Experiments have hypotheses, a testable prediction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Population-</h4>
      <p>A population is a group or category of people being researched.</p>
      <br />
      <p>A representative sample represents all people in a population.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Random sample is when everyone in the population has an equal chance of
        being chosen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Stratified sample is when a population is divided into subcategories and
        a random sample is taken from each.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Random sampling happens so that the sample is representative of the
        population because researchers need to be able to generalize their
        findings to the whole population.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Random assignment is when the random sample is assigned to a
        experimental or control group. This minimizes preexisting differences
        between the groups so that it doesn’t impact the results of the
        experiment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Experimental group is the group that receives the special treatment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Control group is the comparison group that doesn’t receive the special
        treatment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The independent variable (cause) is the factor being manipulated and
        studied.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The dependent variable (effect) is the factor that changes in response
        to the independent variable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both groups will receive the independent variable, the difference is in
        the degree of the variable they receive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A placebo is a fake treatment. It tests the true effect of the
        independent variable since beliefs can alter behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Placebo effect is when people don’t know they are getting a placebo and
        it still has the same effects regardless.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Controlling for bias-</h4>
      <p>
        Single blind research is when only the participants are unaware of the
        degree of the variable they receive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Double blind research is when both participants and researchers are
        unaware of which group participants are in.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Confounding variables are outside variables that could affect the
        experiment other than the independent variable. Random assignment
        controls for these variables.
