      <h2>Lesson 1.4 Research Methods</h2>
      <h4>Correlations-</h4>
      <p>
        Two variables with a relationship with one another. They can rise and
        fall with each other or have a opposite rise and fall. This is known as
        a positive// and negative/\ correlation. A perfect correlation is +1,
        negative is -1, no correlation is 0.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Scatterplot-</h4>
      <p>
        A graphic representation of a correlation. It is comprised of points.
        The slope shows the direction and the scatter of the points shows the
        strength of the relationship.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Correlation coefficient-</h4>
      <p>
        A statistical measure showing the degree of the relationship between
        variables. The components are the positive and negative sign and the
        number. The number indicates the strength.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Correlation and causation-</h4>
      <p>Two variables being correlated doesn’t show how are related.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Types of Research-</h4>
      <p>Descriptive/observational research describes a behavior.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Correlation research finds the relationship between variables.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Experimental research happens in a controlled setting with manipulated
        variables.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Naturalistic observation is the observation of behavior in its natural,
        typically occurring environment. Jane Goodall did this with gorillas. It
        is valuable where other methods would be disruptive. When people know
        they are being observed, they tend to act differently (Hawthorne
        Effect). Ethically you have to tell people they are being observed.
        These observations can be distorted if they are expecting a certain
        behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Case Study-</h4>
      <p>
        is an intensive exam of a behavior and mental process associated with a
        certain person. It is useful when something is complex or rare and often
        used in clinical work and neuropsychology. It is unlikely to be
        representative of the general population, and unable to be generalized.
        Provides material for further research.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Surveys-</h4>
      <p>
        are a technique for ascertaining self-reported attitudes of people by
        questioning a random representative sample. Can be used as part of the
        operational definition in experiments. Can be used as an operational
        definition. The validity is dependent on how questions are worded and
        the representativeness of the people. Some people might not honestly
        complete the survey and they might say what they think they should say,
        not their actual thoughts. A good way to gather large amounts of info.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Quasi-experiments (ex post facto designs)-</h4>
      <p>
        are studies with the same control as experiments but do not have the
        random assignments of participants. This would be carried because it
        would be unethical for an actual experiment. Conclusions aren’t as firm
        as actual experiments but allow for research in an otherwise impossible
        ethical setting.
