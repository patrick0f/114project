      <h2>Lesson 1.6 Statistics</h2>
      <h4>Statistical reasoning-</h4>
      <p>Statistical procedures analyze and interpret data.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Measures of tendency-</h4>
      <p>
        Mean, median, mode. Mode is the most frequently occurring score in a
        distribution.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Standard deviation is the average difference from each score to the
        mean.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A normal distribution creates a bell-shaped curve. The mean, median, and
        mode are at the exact same point.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A skewed distribution has outliers that can skew the data. A negative
        skew has a outlier on the left side, a positive skew has an outlier on
        the right side. The mean is the most impacted by outliers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Inferential statistics estimates what is happening in a sample to make
        predictions about the rest of the population. There is a chance for
        error, so the hypothesis should be tested for significance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Null hypothesis states that there is no difference between two sets of
        data. Until the research shows by proving the hypothesis that there is a
        difference, any difference shown must be attributed to chance. A null is
        essentially the counterpart/opposite of the hypothesis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A type 1 error is when the null is rejected but it is actually true, a
        type 2 error is when the null is accepted but it is actually false.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Statistical significance-</h4>
      <p>
        The difference between two groups, the experimental and control, is not
        due to chance. It is due to an actual difference, the independent
        variable. Data is significant when the likelihood of difference due to
        chance is less than 5% or a 95% chance of difference due to independent
        variable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>This is expressed as p. (p â‰¤ 0.05)</p>

      <h4>Empiricism-</h4>
      <p>Theory that all knowledge comes from experience and the senses</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cohort sequential study-</h4>
      <p>
        An experimental design where multiple measures are taken over time from
        two or more age groups.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cross sectional study-</h4>
      <p>
        An experimental design where one measure is taken from many people at
        one point in time.
