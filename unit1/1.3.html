      <h2>Lesson 1.3 Ethics</h2>
      <h4>Ethics-</h4>
      <p>
        Informed consent is when participants are completely informed about
        aspects of the study that might influence their decision to participate
        and obtain their voluntary permission. Assent is when minors must be
        continuously asked for their consent to participate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Limited deception is when deception is only allowed when it is essential
        to the study and tell them about the deception at the end during the
        debriefing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Any discomfort and risk must be prevented as best as possible so as to
        prevent any long term negative consequences. Participants must be told
        that they are free to join and leave at any time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Confidentiality is when personal information is kept secret. Results
        must be reported in a way that doesn’t disclose personal information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Debriefing is when all relevant info about the experiment and purpose of
        it if deception was used. Participants must leave the same way they came
        into the experiment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Animals-</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes research uses animals. Animals and humans share similar
        behaviors. Info from animals can show things that would be impossible to
        show from humans or unethical to show.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Animals aren’t subjected to extreme pain, starvation in research. If
        they are, it must be first deemed necessary for the benefit of human
        welfare in order to be approved. Guidelines that show how to care for
        the animals exist.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Animal research must be approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use
        Committee (IACUC).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Animals have the ABCs of lab research.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Appropriate-</h4>
      <p>Means nothing cruel and unusual.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Beneficial-</h4>
      <p>Means that it must benefit human psychological research.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Caring-</h4>
      <p>
        Means it must care for the well-being of the animals. There are
        regulations for cages, food, etc.
