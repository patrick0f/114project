      <h2>Lesson 1.1 Introduction to Psychology</h2>
      <h4>Philosophers and Psychology-</h4>
      <p>
        The Hebrews, Aristotle, and Augustine thought that the mind and body are
        connected. Socrates, Plato, and Descartes thought that the mind and body
        are distinct from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Socrates and Plato think that some ideas are inborn. Aristotle and John
        Locke think that the mind is a blank slate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dorothea Dix-</h4>
      <p>
        The first advocate for those suffering from mental illness and insisted
        they get help. Created the first mental asylum during the American Civil
        War.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Structuralism-</h4>
      <p>
        A major school of thought in psychology. Studies the consciousness, how
        the mind is organized (structured) and how its elements relate to one
        another.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Wilhelm Wundt-</h4>
      <p>
        Is considered the father of psychology since he established the first
        formal psychological lab in 1879. He used introspection, looking inward
        to consider decisions and thinking.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Functionalism-</h4>
      <p>Another major school of thought.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>William James-</h4>
      <p>
        The first American psychologist. Criticized Wundt for his narrow ideas.
        Influenced by Darwin, he wanted to understand how consciousness,
        thoughts, and feelings work (function) to help people adapt in their
        environments. He used introspection, but also questionnaires and tests
        to truly see what people thought.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gestalt Psychology-</h4>
      <p>
        Founded as a revolt against Wundt by Max Wertheimer, it believed that
        consciousness was best understood by observing the whole experience
        rather than breaking it down into various elements. “The whole is
        greater than the sum of its parts.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Psychoanalysis-</h4>
      <p>
        Sigmund Freud focused on abnormal behavior. He believed all behavior and
        mental processes were influenced by unconscious mind and forces and that
        problems came from unresolved conflicts in the unconscious mind. He used
        free association, saying what comes to mind without censorship, and
        dream analysis to understand the mind. His ideas are controversial but
        still hold a lot of influence on psychology.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Behaviorism-</h4>
      <p>
        Became popular in the 1920s-1960s. B.F. Skinner and JB Watson disagreed
        with a lot of the field and believed that psychology should only study
        what can be observed and measured objectively (Watson).
      </p>
      <p>
        Skinner insisted that external factors shaped behavior, that your
        thoughts and hidden unconscious parts of the mind are irrelevant.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Contemporary Psychology-</h4>
      <p>
        Psychology is defined as the study of behavior, what we do, and mental
        processes, inner thoughts and feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is controversy over if our traits and behaviors are based on
        biology (nature) or our environment (nurture).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biopsychosocial approach-</h4>
      <p>
        Three influences that come together to influence behavior and the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Biological influences include genetic predispositions, genetic
        mutations, natural selection of physiology and behaviors, and genes
        responding to the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychological influences include learned fears and expectations,
        emotional responses, cognitive processing, and perceptual
        interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Socio-cultural influences include the presence of others, cultural,
        societal, and familial expectations, peer influences, and compelling
        models, like those of media.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perspectives-</h4>
      <p>
        Biological perspective focuses on understanding how the brain and body
        physically creates thought, emotions, and memories. It asks how are
        messages transmitted through the body or how blood chemistry is linked
        with motives. Biological perspective is purely physical processes and
        anatomy in the body and mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Evolutionary perspective focuses on how natural selection had caused
        behavior and genes to develop. It asks how evolution influences behavior
        tendencies. Evolutionary perspective is about natural selection,
        reproduction, and spreading the gene pool.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Behavior genetics focuses on how our genes and environment influences
        individual differences. It asks to what extent does our genes or
        environment impact our personality. Behavior genetics is about behavior,
        environment, and how genes predispose behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychodynamic (new psychoanalysis) focuses on the unconscious mind as
        the director of behavior. It asks how does our unconscious energy
        motivate us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Behavioral perspective focuses on how our behavior is shaped by our
        learning process. It asks how we learn to fear things, how do we change
        certain behaviors. Behavioral perspective is about learning processes
        and learning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cognitive perspective is about how we process information and how our
        perceptions influence actions. It asks how we use info to remember and
        how our interpretation impacts behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Humanistic perspective focuses on human growth, potential, and
        self-concept. It asks how we make ourselves better people. Humanistic
        perspective is about free will, self-actualization, and full-potential.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Socio-cultural perspective focuses on human behavior interpreted in a
        social and cultural context. It asks how various groups are alike and
        different and how are social influences different across different
        cultures. Socio-cultural perspective is about family, neighbors, peers,
        race, and culture.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Psychological Domains</h4>
