      <h2>
        Lesson 7.7 Achievement
      </h2>
      <h4>Sigmund Freud-</h4>
      <p>
        Said that a healthy life is filled with love and work. People have
        different attitudes towards work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those who see it as a job simply think of it as a necessary way to make
        money.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those who see it as a career see it as a way to advance to a higher
        position.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those who see it as a calling try to fulfill a socially useful activity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Flow-</h4>
      <p>
        The observed quality of someone’s life that increases when engaged
        purposefully. It marks immersion into one’s work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It lies in the realm of no work, apathy, and underwhelming, and excess
        work, anxiety, and overwhelming. People who flow into their work, such
        as artists, dancers, and composers are driven less by extrinsic rewards
        such as money and promotion, and more by intrinsic rewards such as
        self-expression and fulfillment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Industrial organization psychology-</h4>
      <p>Applies psychological principles to the workplace.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Personnel psychology-</h4>
      <p>Using psychology principles to select and evaluate workers.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Organizational psychology-</h4>
      <p>
        Studies how work environments and management styles influence worker
        motivation, satisfaction, and productivity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Human factors psychology-</h4>
      <p>Designing optimum work environments.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Achievement motivation-</h4>
      <p>
        Stable, learned characteristics in which satisfaction is obtained by
        striving for and attaining a level of excellence. The level of need for
        achievement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        BF Skinner created a daily discipline schedule that led to him becoming
        the 20th century’s most influential psychologist.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with high achievement motivation tend to choose more challenging
        tasks and complete them successfully. They avoid easy success and
        success that is unattainable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those with low achievement motivation tend to be motivated primarily by
        a desire to avoid failure, so they will either choose very easy tasks or
        extremely difficult tasks. They avoid moderately difficult tasks because
        they are afraid of failing at something someone else completed
        successfully.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Achievement motivation stems from parents. Parents who encourage their
        kids to try difficult tasks, give praise and rewards, encourage the
        child to find ways to succeed, and prompt their children to go on to
        more difficult challenges will create high achievement motivation
        children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        General cultural influences such as books can also affect the levels one
        has of achievement and motivation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Thematic Apperception Test-</h4>
      <p>
        People are shown ambiguous pictures and are told to write a story about
        what is happening. A scoring system is used to determine the amount of
        achievement imagery in people’s stories and showed the need for
        achievement as being high or low.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intrinsic motivation-</h4>
      <p>Doing something because of enjoyment and/or personal satisfaction.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Extrinsic motivation-</h4>
      <p>Doing something because of a concrete, tangible reward.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Motivational conflict-</h4>
      <p>
        There are many different motives and responses, so they may come into
        conflict with each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Approach-approach conflict-</h4>
      <p>
        One must choose between two equally attractive options, like going to a
        birthday party or hanging out with friends. As the importance of the
        choice increases, so does the difficulty of making the decision.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Avoidance-avoidance conflict-</h4>
      <p>
        One must choose between two equally unattractive options, like declaring
        bankruptcy or selling your home. These are typically very difficult to
        resolve and often create intense emotions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Approach-avoidance conflict-</h4>
      <p>
        There are both appealing and negative aspects to a decision that must be
        made. They are difficult to resolve and result in long periods of
        indecision.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Multiple approach-avoidance conflict-</h4>
      <p>
        One has to choose between both attractive and negative aspects of the
        available alternatives, like choosing a college. They are difficult to
        resolve because it may be hard to compare the features of options.
