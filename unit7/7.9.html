      <h2>Lesson 7.9 Psychoanalytic Theories of Personality</h2>
      <h4>Neo-Freudians-</h4>
      <p>
        From psychoanalytic to psychodynamic, Alfred Adler believed in childhood
        tensions that were social in nature, not sexual.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Inferiority complex-</h4>
      <p>A child’s struggle during growth for superiority and power.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Karen Horney-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed in the social aspect of childhood growth and that children are
        trying to overcome helplessness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        She countered Freud’s assumption that women have weak superegos and
        suffer from penis envy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Penis envy-</h4>
      <p>
        Freud’s assumption that since women don’t have penises and men do, and
        men have power in society, that women are envious of men’s penises due
        to their association with power.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Collective consciousness-</h4>
      <p>
        A common reservoir of images derived from our species’ past that is full
        of archetypes, believed in by Carl Jung.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Archetype-</h4>
      <p>
        Universal, symbolic images that appear across cultures through stories
        and art.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Projective test-</h4>
      <p>
        A psychological instrument that reveals the hidden unconscious mind. A
        psychoanalyst projects their interpretations of the results of the tests
        to derive meaning. The two main tests are the thematic apperception test
        and the Rorschach inkblot test.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Critics say that projective tests lack reliability in the consistency of
        the results and validity in the prediction of the results. Train raters
        evaluating the same patient can have different unreliable
        interpretations, and these tests can misdiagnose a normal person as
        invalidly pathological.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Thematic apperception test-</h4>
      <p>
        Developed by Henry Murray, a projective test where people express their
        feelings and interests through the stories they make up about ambiguous
        scenes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Rorschach inkblot test-</h4>
      <p>
        The most widely used projective test that has 10 inkblots created by
        Herman Rorschach. These blots serve to identify people’s inner feelings
        by analyzing their interpretations.
