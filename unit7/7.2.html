      <h2>Lesson 7.2 Experiencing Emotion</h2>
      <h4>Unconscious expression of emotions-</h4>
      <p>
        We have a fast response system that relies on deep brain circuitry to
        operate automatically and is linked to implicit memories. It acts as a
        defense that produces emotions to help us get out of dangerous
        situations. We are receptive to possible threats because of the
        amygdala, which looks for potential subliminal threats. This system is
        quick to learn about emotional responses through classical conditioning
        but is slow to forget.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conscious expression of emotions-</h4>
      <p>
        Generates emotions slower, but delivers more complete information to the
        consciousness, linked with explicit memories. Relies heavily on the
        cerebral cortex.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Limbic system and amygdala-</h4>
      <p>
        Processes extreme emotions like fear and aggression and is always alert
        for threats, contributing to fight or flight response.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reticular formation-</h4>
      <p>
        Works with thalamus and amygdala to monitor incoming info. If a threat
        is detected, it sets responses in motion that arouse the body. The
        responses in the brain cause heart, respiration, and muscle tension.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cerebral cortex-</h4>
      <p>
        Interprets events and associates them with memories and feelings. The
        right side has negative emotions, and the left side has positive
        emotions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Autonomic nervous system-</h4>
      <p>
        The Sympathetic nervous system becomes active when startled (fight or
        flight) or experiencing an unpleasant emotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The parasympathetic nervous system dominates pleasant emotions.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Hormones-</h4>
      <p>
        Serotonin is involved in feelings of depression, epinephrine is produced
        in fear, and norepinephrine is more abundant in anger.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Basic emotions-</h4>
      <p>
        Izard said we have 10 basic emotions: joy, excitement, surprise,
        sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, shame, and guilt.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fear-</h4>
      <p>
        Learned through conditioning and observation. We are biologically
        predisposed to fear things because the response helps us survive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The amygdala plays a key role in associating emotions with situations.
        If the amygdala is damaged, the fear response could be diminished due to
        a lack of association.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conditioning-</h4>
      <p>Associating emotions with events</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Observation-</h4>
      <p>Watching others display emotions in response to stimuli</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Anger-</h4>
      <p>
        Chronic hostility is linked to heart disease. Controlled expression of
        anger is good, better than pent up or irrational anger.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Catharsis hypothesis-</h4>
      <p>
        Releasing aggressive energy relieves aggressive urges. Research has
        shown that expressing anger can be temporarily calming, but it doesnâ€™t
        clear feelings of rage. The expression of anger can lead to more
        hostility due to the reinforcement experienced if not careful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Happiness-</h4>
      <p>
        Those who are happy see the world as safe, make decisions easier, are
        more cooperative, and live happier. Significant negative events seldom
        destroy happiness permanently.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Feel-good do-good phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>People are helpful to others when they are in a good mood.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Adaption level phenomenon-</h4>
      <p>
        Our tendency to judge stimuli as relative to those previously
        experienced. We have neutral levels and react to variations as they
        occur up and down from these levels. Winning the lottery would lead to a
        surge of initial happiness, but then adaptation would occur, and it
        would become the new norm.
