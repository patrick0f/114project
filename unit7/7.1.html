      <h2>Lesson 7.1 Theories of Emotion</h2>
      <p>
        Emotions are a mix of physiological activation, expressive behaviors,
        and conscious experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>James Lange Theory-</h4>
      <p>
        William James and Carl Lange proposed an idea that was opposed to common
        sense view. It proposed that physiological activity preceded emotional
        experience; bodily changes cause the feeling of emotions. Stimulus
        activates physiological arousal, which causes emotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Seeing a strange man outside causes the sympathetic nervous system to
        fire up and the heartbeat to raise. This creates the emotion of fear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cannon Bard Theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Walter Cannon and Philip Bard questioned the James Lange theory and
        proposed that emotion triggering stimuli and body arousal take place
        simultaneously. The thalamus produces both physical and emotional
        reactions simultaneously as it sends messages through the body. Stimulus
        activates both physiological arousal and emotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Someone suddenly touching you would cause you to tense up and become
        startled simultaneously.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Two factor theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer suggested that psychiatry and
        cognition creates emotions. These emotions have two factors, physical
        arousal and cognitive label. We think about environmental cues and the
        kind of physical arousal to cognitively label the emotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A stranger starts waving at you, which leads to an increased heartbeat
        and breathing rate (physiology), but they are smiling (cognitive label),
        so you end up with a happy emotion instead of fear because you recognize
        that he is friendly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Physiological similarities-</h4>
      <p>
        Physiological responses are similar across emotions. Excitement and fear
        involve similar physiological arousal. Being scared would lead to
        heightened tension, heartbeat, sweating, and shaking. In a state of
        anger, similar physical responses would occur.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Physical responses like finger temperature and facial muscles change
        during fear, rage, and joy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The amygdala shows differences in activation during emotions. The left
        hemisphere, happy emotions, is different from the right hemisphere,
        depressed emotions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Two routes to emotion-</h4>
      <p>
        Zajonc and LeDoux say that some emotions are immediately processed
        without conscious appraisal. Our emotional reactions can be quicker than
        our interpretation of events; we feel before we think. Some neural
        pathways involved in emotion bypass cortical areas involved in thinking
        and go directly to the amygdala.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Lazarus, Schachter, and Singer emphasize that appraisal determines
        emotions. Lazarus says that even instantaneously felt emotions require
        some kind of processing, otherwise, how would we know what weâ€™re
        responding to? Hearing a twig crack, you would have to appraise the
        situation as dangerous in order to even feel scared.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Valence-</h4>
      <p>The positive or negative continuum of emotion</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Arousal-</h4>
      <p>The level of intensity of an emotion</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Dimension of emotion-</h4>
      <p>Our emotions have two dimensions, valence and arousal.</p>
