      <h2>Lesson 7.12 Trait Theory</h2>
      <h4>Trait-</h4>
      <p>
        A tendency to respond in a certain way in different kinds of situations.
        Trait theorists believe that every trait applies to all people and the
        trait can be measured. Theorists look for connections between a person’s
        behaviors.
      </p>

      <h4>Gordon Allport-</h4>
      <p>
        Described personality in terms of fundamental traits, or characteristic
        patterns of behavior to feel or act a certain way. He identified the
        cardinal trait, central trait, and secondary trait.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cardinal trait-</h4>
      <p>
        A characteristic or feature so critical that it defines a person. Martin
        Luther King was a righteous and passionate man.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Central trait-</h4>
      <p>
        Traits that make people predictable. A shy boy doesn’t like talking to
        people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Secondary trait-</h4>
      <p>
        Traits that convey preferences such as for music or food. Someone likes
        pop music or Italian food.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Raymond Cattell-</h4>
      <p>
        Used statistics and factor analysis to identify 16 personality factors
        that he believed were the building blocks of personality. Everyone has
        these 16 factors, just to different degrees.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Eysenck and Eysenck-</h4>
      <p>
        Said that there were 2 basic dimensions of personality that were rated
        on a continuum. Extraversion means being sociable, outgoing, and lively,
        while introversion means being thoughtful, reserved, and quiet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Emotional stability means being relaxed, adjusted, and even-tempered,
        while emotional instability means being moody, anxious, and restless.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Big five-</h4>
      <p>
        A set of expanded factors for an approximation of basic trait
        dimensions. A compilation of work from many researchers and the most
        accepted trait theory in psychology. These traits are rated on a
        continuum.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Emotional stability here is individuals who experience things easily
        without getting upset. The opposite is emotional instability or
        neuroticism, which is those who are always angry and look at the bad
        rather than the good.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Extroversion is associated with being energetic, and the opposite is
        introversion, being quiet and shy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Agreeableness is being sympathetic, cooperative, and kind, and the
        opposite is antagonism, being irritable, suspicious, and jealous.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Openness describes those who are open-minded and willing to try new
        ideas, and the opposite is resistant to new experiences, being reserved
        and unspontaneous.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Conscientiousness is being dutiful, dedicated, and organized, and the
        opposite is impulsiveness, being careless, irresponsible, and quitting
        easily.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Personality inventory-</h4>
      <p>
        Questionnaires used to assess traits that ask people to respond to items
        covering feelings and behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The most used inventory is the MMPI-2, or Minnesota multiphasic
        personality inventory, that was developed to identify abnormal
        personality tendencies. It scores objectively, meaning there is a
        formula for the answers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Personality change-</h4>
      <p>
        Traits appear to remain constant over time and situations, but behaviors
        can change. People don’t act in a predictable manner all the time, but
        one’s average personality is predictable. The social situation has a
        large impact on our behavior.
