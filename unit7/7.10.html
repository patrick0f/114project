      <h2>Lesson 7.10 Humanistic Theories of Personality</h2>
      <p>
        By the 60s psychologists became unhappy with Freud’s negative mindset
        and the mechanistic psychology of behaviorists.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Humanistic theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Emphasizes that individuals control their own behavior. Views human
        nature in a positive light and believes in innate goodness. Popular in
        the 60s because of its person-centered ideas.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-actualization-</h4>
      <p>The process of working to become the best person you can be.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-actualizing person-</h4>
      <p>
        Maslow believed that we try to reach the state of self-actualization or
        fulfilling our own unique potential. This desire exists in all but is
        often blocked by the environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Self-actualizing characteristics include accepting the self
        unconditionally, being spontaneous and natural, having a democratic
        nature, liking privacy, focusing on external problems, having a strong
        ethical and moral sense, having a small and close friend group, and
        being realistic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Carl Rogers-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed that people are naturally good. He thought that the central
        feature of our personality is our self-concept. He thought that people
        must have 3 core concepts in order to truly grow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Genuineness is the ability to be open with one’s feelings and drop
        facades of emotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Acceptance is getting rid of conditions of worth, thinking that you must
        accomplish something in order to be truly worthy, and offering
        unconditional positive regard.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Empathy is sharing our feelings and reflecting meanings, putting
        yourself in other’s shoes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Rogers asked people to describe themselves as they would like to be,
        their ideal selves, and as they actually are, their real selves. If the
        descriptions were close, then they had a positive self-concept.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-concept-</h4>
      <p>
        Our perception of our abilities, behaviors, and characteristics. If it
        is positive, then we act in positive ways.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Humanistic perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Has a great impact on counseling, education, child rearing, and
        management. The concepts can be vague and subjective while lacking
        scientific basis. Individualism can lead to selfishness and corruption.
