      <h2>Lesson 7.6 Sexual Needs</h2>
      <h4>Biopsychosocial influences of sex-</h4>
      <p>
        Biological influences include sexual maturity, sex hormones
        (testosterone and estrogen), and sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychological influences include exposure to stimulating conditions and
        sexual fantasies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Socio-cultural influences include familial and societal values,
        religious and personal values, and cultural expectations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Study of sex-</h4>
      <p>
        The first major study of sex was in the 1940s with researcher Alfred
        Kinsey who interviewed 17,000 people concerning their sexual behavior.
        He rated them from 0-6 on a scale of exclusively heterosexual to
        exclusively homosexual.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sexual response cycle-</h4>
      <p>
        Masters and Johnson brought sex to a laboratory and described human
        sexual response as consisting of 4 phases in sequential order.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The first phase is excitement, where the genitals become engorged with
        blood; the vagina expands and secretes lubricant while the penis
        enlarges.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The second phase is plateauing, where excitement such as breathing,
        pulse, and blood pressure peaks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The third phase is orgasm where contractions occur all over the body,
        there is an increase in breathing, pulse, and blood pressure, and sexual
        release occurs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The fourth phase is resolution where the engorged genitals release
        blood. Males will go into their refractory phase while women resolve
        themselves slower.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sexual scripts-</h4>
      <p>
        Socially learned programs of sexual interpretation and responsiveness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sexual orientation-</h4>
      <p>
        A person’s preference for emotional and sexual relationships with
        individuals of the same sex, other sex, and/or either sex.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Homosexuals have a preference of those same sex, heterosexuals have a
        preference of those opposite sex, and bisexuals don’t have a preference
        for either; they like both.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychologists see sexual orientation as neither willingly chosen nor
        changed. The view of homosexuality remains controversial today due to
        societal, political, and moral factors. Many scientific theories point
        to genetics for causes of sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biological sexual orientation-</h4>
      <p>
        The size of the anterior hypothalamus is smaller, and the anterior
        commissure is larger in homosexual men, suggesting there are biological
        differences in homosexual men.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Homosexuality seems to run in families and is more common in twins (more
        so identical than fraternal).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Genetic engineers can genetically manipulate female flies to act like
        males during courtship and males to act like females.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fetal developments-</h4>
      <p>
        Prenatal hormones affect sexual orientation during fetal development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In female sheep, testosterone exposure in the fetus led to increased
        homosexual behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In humans, female hormone exposure (estrogen) to fetuses resulted in
        attraction to males, regardless of the fetus’ gender.
