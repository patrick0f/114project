      <h2>Lesson 7.11 Social Cognitive Theory of Personality</h2>
      <h4>Social cognitive ideals-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes that we learn behaviors from conditioning, observing, and
        modeling and emphasizes mental processing, focusing on how we interact
        with the environment. Emphasizes interaction of traits with situations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Trait theory is criticized for underestimating situations, it doesn’t
        take into account social situations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reciprocal determinism-</h4>
      <p>
        Created by Albert Bandura, it says that personality is shaped by
        cognitive (internal personal), behavioral, and environmental factors.
        Cognitive factors are beliefs, values, thoughts, and feelings.
        Behavioral factors are the actions we take. Environmental factors are
        social influences. You believe that hard work will take you far, so you
        study hard and get good grades. In the end, you get admiration from
        friends and praise from family.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Different people choose different environments. Peers can influence
        thoughts and preferences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Personalities can determine interpretation and reaction to events.
        Reaction to an emergency will differ depending on personality type.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Personalities will create situations to react to. We treat others the
        way they treat us. If one person is nice, the other person is nice in
        return.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-efficacy-</h4>
      <p>
        A person’s belief about their skills and abilities to perform behaviors.
        The greater the sense of self-efficacy, the more confident a person is
        to deal with challenges. Self-efficacy has a powerful effect on behavior
        yet isn’t considered a trait because it varies given the situation; it
        can’t be generalized across situations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Personal control-</h4>
      <p>
        The sense of controlling or being controlled by the environment. Julian
        Rotter says there is an internal and external locus of control.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>External locus of control-</h4>
      <p>The perception that outside forces determine fate</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Internal locus of control-</h4>
      <p>
        The perception that one’s own actions control fate. Those with an
        internal locus of control have been shown to have higher grades, be less
        likely to succumb to pressure, and be more likely to engage in physical
        activity. There are some things that are outside of personal control,
        however, such as a natural disaster.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Learned helplessness-</h4>
      <p>
        The hopelessness and passive resignation learned when one is unable to
        avoid repeated traumatic events. Occurs when there is a feeling of no
        sense of control over a situation, and this feeling often gets
        transferred over to other situations. People with little control, such
        as those in prison, have lowered morale, increased stress, and often
        gain a sense of learned helplessness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Optimism-</h4>
      <p>
        To have a positive outlook. Excessive optimism can be detrimental, in
        that it can cause blindness to risk such as AIDs, unwanted pregnancy,
        and divorce. Those with abundant optimism also tend to be overconfident
        when they are incompetent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Criticisms of social cognitive perspective-</h4>
      <p>
        Focuses too much on the environment that it fails to recognize a
        person’s inner traits. It doesn’t look at the influence of unconscious
        motives, emotions, or pervasive traits that are also believed to
        influence behavior.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Self-</h4>
      <p>
        The organizer of our thoughts, feelings, and actions. The most important
        item in psychology according to humanistic psychologists.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-esteem-</h4>
      <p>
        Our feeling of self-worth. People who feel good about themselves sleep
        better, don’t conform as easily, are more persistent, less shy, and are
        happier.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Self-serving bias-</h4>
      <p>
        Our readiness to perceive ourselves favorably. People accept
        responsibility for good deeds more than bad ones and see themselves as
        better than average.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Individualists-</h4>
      <p>
        Those with emphasis on the independent self, defined by personal values,
        goals, and attributes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Collectivists-</h4>
      <p>
        Those with emphasis on the collective self, defined by connections with
        other and the goals of the overall group.
