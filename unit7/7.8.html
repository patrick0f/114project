      <h2>Lesson 7.8 Stress</h2>
      <h4>Stress-</h4>
      <p>
        Any circumstance, real or perceived, that threatens one’s well-being.
        The physical and mental changes that occur in reaction to a challenging
        or threatening situation. Severe stress impairs our ability to cope.
        Psychological states can cause physical illness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Stress is a process by which we appraise and cope with environmental
        threats and challenges.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stressor-</h4>
      <p>
        Anything that is a stressful stimulus or a condition that demands
        adaptation. Short lived stressors can have positive effects. Prolongs or
        threatening stress can be harmful, however.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Catastrophic event-</h4>
      <p>A sudden, unexpected experience or trauma that acts as a stressor.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Life changes-</h4>
      <p>
        Life circumstances that create demands which people must adjust to as
        stressors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Chronic stressors-</h4>
      <p>Those that continue over a long period of time, like an illness.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Daily hassles-</h4>
      <p>Mild annoyances that aren’t very significant but add up over time.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stress response-</h4>
      <p>
        Cognitive appraisal is when we identify the threat and determine how to
        cope with it. Physiological response is the body’s reaction. Our
        behavior is the action taken because of stress. Our subjective feelings
        are the emotions we feel because of stress.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stress Response system-</h4>
      <p>
        Canon Bard proposed that stress response is a fast fight or flight
        response marked by release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the
        inner adrenal glands that increases heart and respiration rate and
        mobilizes sugar.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The hypothalamus and pituitary gland also respond to stress slowly by
        triggering outer adrenal glands to secrete glucocorticoids, or cortisol.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>General adaptation syndrome-</h4>
      <p>
        Hans Selye says that stress response to any stimulation is similar.
        Stressed individuals go through 3 phases.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Stage 1 is the alarm reaction when the hypothalamus sets the fight or
        flight response by releasing neurotransmitters and hormones to deal with
        stressful situations. If the stressor persists, this adaptive response
        can become distress because it depletes energy and defense resources,
        causing high blood pressure, immune deterioration, ulcers, and fatty
        deposits in the blood vessels.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Stage 2 begins when the organism rebounds from the reaction. Outwardly,
        the body is trying to resist the stressor, inwardly, the body is trying
        to restore homeostasis and trying to cope. The resistance only applies
        to the original stressor. Another stressor being added would cause the
        defense to be depleted even more and become unable to respond.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Stage 3 is when exhaustion starts to occur. If resistance fails to
        relieve the stress, the symptoms of alarm from stage 1 will reappear,
        accompanied by an even more powerful autonomic nervous system response.
        The autonomic system overcompensates, and so much energy is used that if
        the stressor isn’t removed, exhaustion and eventual death will occur.
        Warning signs of exhaustion include heart attacks, clogged arteries,
        excessive colds, frequent headaches, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stress and illness-</h4>
      <p>
        Stressors and mental processes like worry can affect health and
        resources like the immune system. The human immune response has evolved
        to deal with short term stressors and may react to chronic stressors by
        breaking down. This happens because without a physical enemy, bodily
        responses will maladapt and hurt itself, and the body becomes vulnerable
        to infection/injury.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Persistent stressors and negative emotions like smoking, drinking, poor
        nutrition, and sleep will cause the release of stress hormones.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Type A personality-</h4>
      <p>
        Competitive, hard-driving, verbally aggressive, and anger prone people
        that become stressed out quickly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Type B personality-</h4>
      <p>
        Easy-going and relaxed people that deal with stress easily and don’t get
        very anxious.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Problem focused coping-</h4>
      <p>
        Reducing stress by changing events that cause stress or how we react to
        stress. When your car keeps breaking down and stressing you out, you go
        buy a new one or get the parts replaced.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Emotion focused coping-</h4>
      <p>
        Reducing stress by attending to personal emotional needs when changing
        the situation isn’t possible. When you can’t change the fact that you
        have to work overtime and it stresses you out, you try to find ways to
        relax when you get home.
