      <h2>Lesson 7.4 Motivation</h2>
      <h4>Motivation-</h4>
      <p>
        The influences that account for the initiation, direction, intensity,
        and persistence of behavior. It is why we do what we do. Aron Ralston
        was pinned down by a rock and he was motivated to cut his arm off.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sources of motivation include biological factors, emotional factors,
        cognitive factors, and social factors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Instinct-</h4>
      <p>
        An innate, automatic disposition to respond in a particular way when
        confronted with a stimulus. Birds build nests because the behavior is
        engrained in their genetics.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Humans do have inborn instincts, our reflexes, but they fade after a few
        months. Most psychologists believe behavior is directed by psychological
        forces.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Drive reduction theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Believes that motivation results from imbalances in homeostasis. These
        imbalances create a need, and the brain responds by creating a drive.
        The organism t=is then prompted to take action to satisfy the drive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Your body needs water, so it creates a drive in the form of thirst. Your
        body’s drive reducing behavior would then be drinking water.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Incentive theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Our needs/drives push us into action. Incentives pull us to satisfy our
        needs. The value of an incentive is influenced by biological and
        cognitive factors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Incentive-</h4>
      <p>Positive or negative stimuli</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Optimum arousal-</h4>
      <p>
        Human motivation seeks optimum levels of arousal. Yerkes Dobson law says
        that we perform the best when we are moderately aroused. We decrease our
        arousal when we are stressed and increase arousal when bored.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs-</h4>
      <p>
        As humans, we have certain needs that must be met. Biological needs are
        the most important and must be fulfilled first. We are motivated to move
        up and strive towards the level of self-actualization.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Starting from our most important needs, biological and physiological
        needs include basic life needs like air, food, drink, shelter, sex, and
        sleep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After that, safety needs include protection, security, order, law, and
        stability.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On top of that, belongingness and love needs include family, affection,
        relationships, and groups.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Then, esteem needs include achievements, status, responsibilities, and
        reputation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Lastly, self-actualization needs include personal growth and fulfilment.
