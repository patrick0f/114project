      <h2>Lesson 7.3 Expressing Emotions</h2>
      <h4>Paul Ekman-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed that people speak and understand facial languages around the
        world. There are 7 emotional facial universals, and they are happiness,
        surprise, fear, sadness, anger, disgust, and contempt.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Nonverbal behavior-</h4>
      <p>
        Women are better at discerning nonverbal emotions than men. Different
        cultures teach men and women to display different emotions. Research has
        not shown one sex to be more emotionally expressive than the other.
        American cultures emphasize free expression of emotion, while many Asian
        cultures emphasize suppression of emotions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many men receive reinforcement for emotional displays of dominance,
        anger, and aggressive behavior, but are punished for displays of
        weakness like depression and sadness from their cultures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Girls receive reinforcement for behaviors that show vulnerability and
        are punished for emotions that suggest dominance from their cultures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Detecting emotion-</h4>
      <p>
        Many find it difficult to detect emotion. Professionals like officers,
        psychiatrists, judges, and polygraphists only detected deceiving
        emotions 54% of the time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Perceiving deception-</h4>
      <p>
        Lying results in heightened attention, dilated pupils, pauses in speech,
        constrained movement, physical and behavioral arousal, posture shifts,
        speech errors, and nervous gestures. Body movements like smiles, hand
        gestures, and eye movements can give signs that contradict the message
        portrayed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>When a person is honest, they tend to avoid eye contact.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Polygraphs-</h4>
      <p>
        Measures the level of arousal with respiratory rate, electro-dermal
        activity (sweatiness), and blood pressure/heart rate, while asking
        critical questions, irrelevant questions, and control questions during
        interrogations. They are not accurate enough to guarantee an evaluation;
        ½ of states don’t admit polygraph evidence in court.
