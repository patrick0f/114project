      <h2>Lesson 7.5 Hunger</h2>
      <h4>Physiology of hunger-</h4>
      <p>
        Stomach contractions, or pangs, send signals to the brain to make us
        aware of hunger. The body typically regulates its blood glucose level.
        The hormone insulin decreases glucose in the blood, creating a sense of
        hunger.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Glucose levels are monitored by receptors in the stomach, liver, and
        intestines that send signals to the two centers of the hypothalamus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Lateral hypothalamus-</h4>
      <p>Stimulates hunger. Without it, we would starving.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Ventromedial hypothalamus-</h4>
      <p>Depresses hunger. Without it, we would eat uncontrollably.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Set-point theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Manipulating the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus would alter the
        body’s weight balance and predisposes us to keep our weight steady.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If weight is lost, or under the balance, food intake would increase, and
        energy expenditure would decrease.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If weight is gained, or above the balance, food intake would decrease,
        and energy expenditure would increase.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Not all researchers believe in the idea of set-point because slow,
        sustained changes to weight can change the set-point.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Basal metabolic rate-</h4>
      <p>
        The body’s resting rate of energy expenditure that fluctuates according
        to activity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Eating at different intervals-</h4>
      <p>
        We eat when triggered by the presence of food, especially tasty, high
        calorie food.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>We eat because it is time to eat a meal, like lunch or dinner.</p>
      <br />
      <p>We eat at social events because we are expected to do so.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        During stress and depression, we eat more or less and different types of
        foods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Other eating cues include the holidays or when watching shows.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Anorexia nervosa-</h4>
      <p>
        An eating disorder characterized by a normal weight, typically
        adolescent woman, losing dramatic amounts of weight continuously through
        self-starvation yet still feeling overweight.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Bulimia nervosa-</h4>
      <p>
        An eating disorder characterized by episodes of overeating high calorie
        food, followed by vomiting, laxative use, or excessive exercise. Most
        bulimics are average weight to slightly overweight.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Causes include low self-esteem, stress, cultural factors, and biological
        mechanisms dealing with satiety.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Binge eating-</h4>
      <p>Recurrent binge eating without the purging of bulimia.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Body image-</h4>
      <p>
        Western culture over-emphasizes a thin body image more than other
        cultures. Cultures that emphasize appearance more have a higher rate of
        eating disorders.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Biopsychosocial influences of hunger-</h4>
      <p>
        Biological influences include the mid-hypothalamic centers in the brain
        that monitor appetite, appetite hormones, stomach pangs, set point
        weight, attractions to certain foods, and adaptive wariness to certain
        foods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychological influences include the sight and smell of tasty foods, the
        memory of time elapsed since the last meal, and mood.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Socio-cultural influences include culturally learned taste preferences
        and learned restraint in cultures idealizing thinness.
