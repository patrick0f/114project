      <h2>Lesson 6.5 Adulthood Develpment</h2>
      <h4>Early and middle adulthood-</h4>
      <p>
        At the range of 20-65. Early adulthood is centered around careers. The
        midlife transition occurs in a person’s 40s and is where one may
        question their life and accomplishments, mainly due to the idea of
        death. For most, the process of middle age is calm, focusing on the
        present and coming to terms with their decisions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        People are still getting married, but rates of living together and
        divorce are higher than before. Around 90% of heterosexual adults marry
        and 75% of divorcees will remarry. 50% of first marriages end in
        divorce.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Women’s roles-</h4>
      <p>
        Close to 75% of married women with children work outside the home. Most
        of those working will come home to do housework. Employed mothers put in
        an extra month of 24 hours days during the course of a year, yet most
        working women still report personal satisfaction and a sense of
        contribution.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Late adulthood-</h4>
      <p>
        The age of 65 and onwards. Many physical changes in late adulthood
        include thinning gray hair, wrinkly skin, and a loss of height. The
        senses are dulled, reaction times are slowed, and stamina is depleted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Genetic programming theory of aging-</h4>
      <p>
        A kind of built-in time limit for the reproduction of cells exist, and
        the self-destruct button gets pushed at this time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Wear and tear theory of aging-</h4>
      <p>
        The body’s mechanical functions stop working as efficiently as people
        age.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cognitive changes-</h4>
      <p>
        Skills related to fluid intelligence decline in old age, but skills
        related to crystallized intelligence remain strong. Neural processing
        slows down which makes it so memory processing takes longer. Memory loss
        in old age is limited to episodic memories. If a person stays physically
        and mentally active, memory loss will be almost nonexistent. However,
        diseases like Alzheimer’s can cause memory loss.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Disengagement theory of aging-</h4>
      <p>
        Aging produces a gradual withdrawal from the world on a physical,
        psychological, and social level. It provides an opportunity for
        reflection and decreased emotional investment at a time when
        relationships will be affected be death.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Activity theory of aging-</h4>
      <p>
        Those who age most successfully are those who maintain the levels of
        social interaction they experienced in middle adulthood. Late adulthood
        should be a continuation of the activities in which people participated
        during earlier life.

      <h4>Elizabeth Kubler Ross-</h4>
      <p>
        Spent her career studying tragedy, death, and grief. She developed the
        five stages of grief that all people experience. The stages are denial,
        anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, and they occur in no
        particular order.
