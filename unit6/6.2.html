      <h2>Lesson 6.2 Prenatal/Newborn Development</h2>
      <h4>Prenatal influences-</h4>
      <p>
        Nurture begins in the womb. If the mother takes drugs, is ill, or has
        excessive stress can influence the developing fetus. These chemicals are
        called teratogens.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Experience-</h4>
      <p>
        Experience helps develop a brain’s neural connections. In an enriched
        environment, rats will develop a heavier and thicker brain cortex.
        Infants who were picked up and talked to more gained more weight and
        develop faster neurologically. If the brain isn’t stimulated, it will
        operate on the use it or lose it principle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Selection effect-</h4>
      <p>
        Kids choose friends similar to themselves, at least in important ways
        such as in appearance and personality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Peer influence-</h4>
      <p>
        Nature seems to play a role in the influence of our peers. We spend most
        of our time playing, working, and mating with our peers, so nature
        predisposes us to be sensitive to their styles and opinions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both parental and peer influences play a role in shaping one’s life.
        Parents influence our sense of education, discipline, responsibility,
        orderliness, charitableness, interactions with authority, and future
        plans. Peers influence our ideas on our sense of cooperation,
        popularity, and interaction among fellow peers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Culture-</h4>
      <p>
        Behaviors, ideas, attitudes, and traditions shared by a large group of
        people. Culture differs which causes people to differ.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Norm-</h4>
      <p>
        Rules for accepted and expected behavior. Different norms can confuse
        people since they can’t understand how others can be so different.
        Different norms include personal space, levels of expressiveness, and
        pace of life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Individualism-</h4>
      <p>
        Often in western cultures, a concept where kids should think for
        themselves, be independent, and set their own goals.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Collectivism-</h4>
      <p>
        Often in Asian and African cultures, a concept where there is a communal
        culture that emphasizes family honor, dignity, and social harmony.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gender-</h4>
      <p>
        In nature, genders differ genetically. When an egg is fertilized, XX
        chromosomes mean it’ll be a girl and XY chromosomes means it’ll be a
        boy. Mothers will always give an X chromosome, but fathers can give
        either an X or Y chromosome.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>In nurture, gender is also socially determined.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gender roles-</h4>
      <p>
        Expectations about the way men and women behave, which vary across
        cultures and time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gender identity-</h4>
      <p>The sense of being male or female, how we identify ourselves.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gender typing-</h4>
      <p>
        The acquisition of a masculine or feminine role, what people do or learn
        in order to become masculine or feminine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Traditional gender roles-</h4>
      <p>
        Women are expected to be submissive, caring, and take care of their
        children and husbands. Men are expected to be independent, money-makers,
        and initiative takers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Social learning theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Children learn gender linked behaviors through observing and imitating
        others as well as through reward and punishment. Research has shown that
        even if traditional gender roles are discouraged, children will still
        organize themselves into girl and boy roles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gender schema theory-</h4>
      <p>
        Children learn from their cultures a concept of what it means to be
        male/female and adjust behavior accordingly. Boys might not do a sewing
        project because they see it as a girly thing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conception-</h4>
      <p>
        When a male sperm fertilizes a female egg. At this point, the egg blocks
        off all other sperm.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have, only 1/5000 of
        these eggs will mature. Men start producing sperm at puberty and produce
        it 24/7 for the rest of their life. The sperm’s peak quality is around
        19-24 years old.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A fertilized egg contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. 23 halves from each
        parent. Each chromosome contains thousands of genes. Genes produce the
        particular characteristics of each person.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        DNA is the smallest, genes are composed of DNA sequences, and then
        chromosomes are made up of genes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some genes are responsible for our organ systems and vital body parts,
        and others are responsible for body structure parts like eye color and
        height. Gender is determined by combinations of genes in the 23rd
        chromosome.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Zygote-</h4>
      <p>
        A fertilized egg. Fewer than half of zygotes and pregnancies survive 2
        weeks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Embryonic stage (embryo)-</h4>
      <p>
        At 2 weeks, the zygote becomes an embryo when the egg cell attaches to
        the uterine wall. At 4 weeks, the embryo has developed a beating heart,
        brain, and intestine track. At 8 weeks, the embryo is an inch long with
        arms and a distinct face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fetal stage (fetus)-</h4>
      <p>
        From 8 weeks to birth (38 weeks), developing newborns are called
        fetuses. At 4 months old, fetal movements are detectable by mothers. At
        6 months old, eyelids will open, grasp, and taste will also develop. The
        fetus continues to grow during the last two months and will normally
        weigh 7 pounds and be 20 inches in length when born.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Age of viability-</h4>
      <p>
        The point where babies can survive if born prematurely at 24 weeks. 50%
        of premature babies survive at 24 weeks and the percentage gets higher
        as more time passes for development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Phenylketonuria/PKU-</h4>
      <p>
        The inability to break down protein. Ingesting protein would cause
        lowered physical and mental processes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Tay-Sachs disease-</h4>
      <p>
        The inability to break down fat, which causes build up in system and the
        destruction of brain and nerve cells until the nervous system starts to
        shut down. This disease shows up at around 4-6 months old and causes
        death at the age of 5. Parents with this defect will give their child a
        ¼ chance of carrying it. It occurs most frequently in Jews.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Down syndrome-</h4>
      <p>
        Occurs when a zygote receives an extra chromosome at the moment of
        conception. Causes intellectual disability, usually in the mild to
        moderate range. This is related to a mother’s age, most common in babies
        of mothers aged 35 and up. Those with down syndrome have upward slanted
        eyes, smaller noses, ears, and mouths, and sometimes smaller
        hands/necks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Teratogens-</h4>
      <p>
        Environmental agents such as drugs, chemicals, or viruses that can
        create birth defects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Rubella, or German measles, can cause blindness, deafness, heart
        abnormalities, and stillbirth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis can cause intellectual disability, physical deformities, and
        miscarriages.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>AIDS can be passed on from mother to child.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Using drugs like cocaine can cause babies being born addicted to drugs.
        Some legal drugs can also cause fetal abnormalities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Smoking can result in less nutrients being received by the fetus,
        resulting in lower birth weight and bad effects on the brain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fetal alcohol syndrome/FAS-</h4>
      <p>
        A condition that results in physical and intellectual disability from
        the consumption of alcohol by mothers. Those with FAS are very small,
        have small eyes and upturned noses, and very small brains.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Newborns-</h4>
      <p>
        All babies are born with most of the brain cells they will ever have and
        reflexes, which are unlearned involuntary responses that occur
        automatically with stimuli.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Rooting reflex-</h4>
      <p>The automatic turn of the head when the cheek is touched.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sucking reflex-</h4>
      <p>The sucking of anything that touches the lips.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Startle reflex-</h4>
      <p>
        An infant will fling their arms, fan their fingers, and arch their back
        in response to noise. Babies do this to make themselves appear large and
        get their mother’s attention and then will curl up to make their
        presence smaller.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Babinski reflex-</h4>
      <p>Toes will fan out when the edge of the sole is stroked.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These reflexes are lost after the first few months and are replaced by
        more complex behaviors because at that point, babies are able to make
        associations. When something touches their cheek at that point, they
        already know it should be a pacifier.
