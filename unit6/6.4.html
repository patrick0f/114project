      <h2>Lesson 6.4 Adolescence</h2>
      <p>
        Adolescence begins with puberty, around age 11-14, when sexual organs
        mature and ends at the beginning of independent adulthood. Self-image
        can be greatly impacted when one physically matures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Early maturing boys tend to be more athletic, popular, and have a more
        positive self-concept. However, they have more difficulty in school,
        commit more acts of delinquency, and may become involved with substance
        abuse. In the long run, early maturing boys are more responsible and
        cooperative in later life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Boys that develop later are smaller and less coordinated, looking less
        attractive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Early maturing girls are more sought after romantically and have more
        self-esteem than later maturing girls. Early development can be
        embarrassing for girls.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Girls that develop later have higher satisfaction with their bodies in
        later years because they tend to be tall and slim, the societal standard
        for beauty.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Cognitive development-</h4>
      <p>
        By adolescence, we are in the formal operational stage, and begin to
        reason hypothetically and deduce consequences, leading to greater
        understanding of moral principles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Lawrence Kohlberg-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed that moral reasoning helped guide judgement and behavior and
        proposed dilemmas for reasoning at different levels. His theory of moral
        development assumes that people go through levels in a fixed order.
        There are no real ages associated with the levels, but he believed that
        that the highest level required at least 13 years old. His theory had 3
        levels.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Preconventional-</h4>
      <p>
        Young children perform actions based on reward/punishment and are
        selfish or self-centered. If someone receives a reward for doing
        something, they would be in the preconventional stage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conventional-</h4>
      <p>
        Being interested in pleasing others and doing what is right socially.
        Considering more than the self, thinking of family and society as a
        whole.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Postconventional-</h4>
      <p>
        Uses higher reasoning to guide behavior, thinks about problems in terms
        of justice and basic human rights. Kohlberg didn’t think that many
        people made it to this level of reasoning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Erik Erikson-</h4>
      <p>
        Created the idea of psychosocial development, which involves interacting
        with one another and knowledge of oneself as a member of society. He
        believed that passage through the stages requires the resolution of a
        conflict.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Trust vs Mistrust-</h4>
      <p>
        The first stage is from birth to 18 months old. Babies are dependent on
        others to meet their physical and emotional needs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If parents care for the baby and create a sense of attachment, then it
        will develop trust and predictability. If the care is inconsistent or
        lacking, then the baby will develop mistrust and paranoia.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Autonomy vs Shame and doubt-</h4>
      <p>
        The second stage is from 18 months to 3 years old. If parents set
        boundaries but let their child make decisions, then they will develop a
        will or sense of independence. If the child is overly restricted, then
        children will be unable to assert themselves. If the parents are too
        lenient, the child will become overly demanding and controlling,
        creating a sense of shame and self-consciousness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Initiative vs guilt-</h4>
      <p>
        The third stage is from 3-6 years old. Children start developing their
        imaginations, curiosity, and independence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If parents react positively, their child will feel confident to take
        risks and have self-confidence. If parents react negatively, their child
        will lack self-sufficiency, self-esteem, and will fear punishment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Industry vs inferiority-</h4>
      <p>
        The fourth stage is from 6-11 years old. Children start to compare
        themselves in social and academic aspects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those that feel they can do tasks will have a sense of pride and
        accomplishment. Those that can’t will feel inferior to others that can.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Identity vs role confusion-</h4>
      <p>
        The fifth stage is from 12-20 years old. Teens start transitioning to
        adulthood and try to discover who they are and what roles they are fit
        for. Pressures to figure out what one wants to do with their life are
        felt. Teens will start separating themselves from their parents and
        relying on their peers. Here, Erikson believed that one had to find
        themselves and figure out their role before being able to truly express
        love.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some have a sense for who they are and have a commitment to their
        future. Others have confusion over what their role is, which can lead to
        an unstable identity and the adoption of a socially unacceptable role.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Intimacy vs isolation-</h4>
      <p>
        The sixth stage from age 20-30. People begin pondering entering a close
        and loving relationship.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They either develop intimacy and a sense of connectedness or develop
        isolation where they draw themselves in and avoid emotional contact.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Generativity vs Stagnation-</h4>
      <p>
        The seventh stage from age 30-65. People ponder the sense of making a
        difference through their children, occupation, and community
        involvement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those that are happy with their life and feel that they have made a
        difference will have a sense of accomplishment. Those that don’t will
        feel worthless and potentially go through a mid-life crisis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Integrity vs despair-</h4>
      <p>
        The last stage from age 65 onwards. People will look back on their life
        and their actions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Those who see their life happily will have a strong sense of peace and
        acceptance. Those who see otherwise will develop a sense of despair and
        look back with a sense of frustration, regret, and disappointment.
