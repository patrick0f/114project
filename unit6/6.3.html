      <h2>Lesson 6.3 Child Development</h2>
      <h4>Maturation-</h4>
      <p>
        The biological growth process that is uninfluenced by experience. The
        sequence of motor development is universal, rolling over, crawling,
        walking, but the timing of the developments is individualistic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most babies sit upright at 6 months, crawl at 8 months, start walking at
        12, and walk by themselves at 15 months old.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Jean Piaget-</h4>
      <p>
        Believed that children moved from stage to stage as they matured and
        were exposed to experience. Dealt with cognitive development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Schema-</h4>
      <p>
        Mental molds where we pour experiences in. A pattern of thought or
        behavior that categorizes information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A child learns the schema for a cow, sees a moose, and calls it a cow.
        She tries to assimilate the animal into an existing scheme but
        accommodates the schema when told that the moose isn’t a cow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Assimilation-</h4>
      <p>Interpreting new information in terms of an existing schema.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Accommodation-</h4>
      <p>Adapting a current schema to fit in new information.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Piaget’s stages of cognitive development-</h4>
      <p>
        Includes sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal
        operational.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From birth to two years old, babies are in the sensorimotor stage where
        they experience the world through their senses. They develop object
        permanence and stranger anxiety.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Object permanence-</h4>
      <p>
        Knowing objects exist even when they are out of sight. Develops around 9
        months.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From age 2-6, toddlers are at the preoperational stage where they
        represent things with words and images and use intuition rather than
        logic. They develop pretend play, egocentrism, and language.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Egocentrism-</h4>
      <p>
        Being unable to perceive things from another’s point of view. Children
        believe that everyone else knows what they know and believes what they
        believe. Kids playing hide and seek can hide their face against a wall,
        assuming that since they cannot see, nobody else can either.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From ages 7-11, children are at the concrete operational stage where
        they think logically about concrete events, grasp analogies, and perform
        arithmetical operations. They develop conservation and mathematical
        operations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Conservation-</h4>
      <p>
        Quantity will remain the same when shape or properties change. The
        amount of water in a glass doesn’t change when poured into a tall skinny
        container.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From age 12 to adulthood, teens are in the formal operational stage
        where they develop abstract thinking. Here, they have abstract logic and
        more mature moral reasoning. Only about 60% of adults reach this stage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Reflections-</h4>
      <p>
        Many researchers believe that development is a continuous process rather
        than a staged one. Children express their mental abilities and
        operations at earlier ages compared to Piaget’s model. Formal logic is
        only a small part of cognition, not as important as Piaget made it out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Stranger anxiety-</h4>
      <p>
        The fear of strangers or unfamiliar people that develops around 8 months
        old. The age where infants form schemas for familiar faces and can’t
        assimilate new faces.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Attachment-</h4>
      <p>
        A positive emotional bond that develops between a child and a person,
        typically a mother.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Harry Harlow-</h4>
      <p>
        Took infant monkeys away from their biological mothers at birth and
        replaced them with a cloth and wire mother. The wire mother provided
        milk while the cloth mother was simply warm. The baby monkeys would
        cling to the cloth monkey mostly and go to the wire monkey to nurse
        occasionally. This shows that attachment is about comfort, not
        biological needs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Human attachment grows through the responsiveness of the caregiver to
        the signals that babies provide, like crying, smiling, and reaching. The
        more the caregiver responds to the signals, the more secure the
        attachment will be.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Secure attachment-</h4>
      <p>Relaxed and attentive caregiving.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Insecure attachment-</h4>
      <p>
        Monkeys would experience great anxiety if their cloth mother was
        removed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Ainsworth Strange Situation-</h4>
      <p>
        A test performed by Mary Ainsworth where a mother and child enter an
        unfamiliar room. The baby is free to explore while the mother stays
        still. A stranger enters the room while the mother leaves and then the
        mother comes back while the stranger leaves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Securely attached children would explore the room but occasionally
        return to their mother. When she left, they would be distressed and go
        to her upon her return. They are able to explore because they trust
        their mother and know she is able to attend to their needs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Insecurely attached children would act differently.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Avoidant children wouldn’t cry when the mother left and avoid her when
        she returned, not seeking her comfort.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Ambivalent children would display anxiety when the mother is in the room
        and be upset when she left. When she returns, they would go back while
        hitting and kicking her. Ambivalent children don’t know if their mother
        will be there to attend to them in their future and will be distressed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Children who are securely attached are more socially and emotionally
        well adjusted, cooperate, and capable. Children that lack a secure
        attachment don’t always have difficulties later on. Attachment style is
        related to the environment in which the child was raised.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Parenting styles-</h4>
      <p>Created by Diana Baumrind, there are 4 main parenting styles.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Authoritarian parents-</h4>
      <p>
        Rigid and demand unquestioning obedience from their children. They have
        strict standards and create unsociable, unfriendly, and withdrawn
        children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Permissible parents-</h4>
      <p>
        Give their children relaxed/inconsistent direction and require very
        little of them. They create immature, moody, dependent, and
        undisciplined children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Authoritative, or democratic, parents-</h4>
      <p>
        Firm and set limits but also explain and use reasoning; they often let
        children play a part in making decisions. By encouraging independence,
        they create likeable, self-reliant, independent, and cooperative
        children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Uninvolved parents-</h4>
      <p>
        Show little care for their children and are emotionally detached. In
        extreme cases, they are guilty of neglect. They create unloved and
        emotionally detached children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The temperament or disposition of the child has a lot to do with the
        parenting style used, so the best style depends.
