      <h2>Lesson 6.1 Introduction to Development</h2>
      <h4>Nature vs nurture-</h4>
      <p>
        Both impact behavior in a way that makes it difficult to know which is
        responsible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Nature is strictly DNA. Nurture includes things like school, family, and
        much more.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Evolutionary psychology-</h4>
      <p>
        Applies the theory of evolution to behavior. It says that behavioral
        similarities come from biological similarities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It believes that human motivation comes from the desire to spread our
        genes, and behavior is thus explained by that motivation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Psychologists say that nature selects behavioral tendencies that
        increase the likelihood of sending one’s genes into the future.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Gender differences-</h4>
      <p>
        Men are attracted to young women while women are attracted to older,
        more mature men. This is because of the biological differences in
        reproduction and what each gender needs to best spread the gene pool.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Younger women are more fertile, while more mature men are more
        dependable and have a stay factor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Behavior genetics-</h4>
      <p>
        Study of the relative power and limits of genetic and environmental
        influences on behavior. Behavior geneticists studied identical twins,
        separated identical twins, and adopted children to learn more about the
        different influences on behavior.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Identical (monozygotic) twins-</h4>
      <p>
        Develop from a single fertilized egg and are genetically identical.
        Identical twins are very similar in abilities, personalities, and
        interests.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Fraternal (dizygotic) twins-</h4>
      <p>
        Develop from separate eggs in the same womb and are genetically similar
        to normal siblings.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Separated twins-</h4>
      <p>
        Thomas Bouchard reported that heredity accounted for 64-74% of the
        differences seen in IQ between the identical twins.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A pair of separated twins, Jerry Levey and Mark Newman, had a striking
        number of identical behaviors when they met for the first time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Adoption studies-</h4>
      <p>
        Adopted children’s personalities are closer to their biological parents
        than their adoptive parents. Adoptive parents do influence things like
        attitude, values, manners, faith, and politics, however. Adoptive
        children also tend to score higher on intelligence tests than their
        biological parents and be more self-giving and altruistic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Heritability-</h4>
      <p>
        The difference due to genes. The extent to which differences in the
        appearance of a trait is due to differences in genes. The more inherited
        a trait is, the less heritable it is as heritability looks at how traits
        are due to differences in genes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Identical twins have a near 0 heritability because the variation in
        their behavior cannot be accounted for by genetic difference.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Two people that live in the same environment have even more heritable
        differences because their environments are similar, the only difference
        is their genes.
